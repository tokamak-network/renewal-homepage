제약(e.g. CPU, bandwidth, memory, disk space) 하에 <strong>짧은 지연시간(low latency)과</strong> <strong>빠른 처리량(high throughput)</strong>을 가지도록 하는데에 많은 노력을 들이고 있다.</p>\\n<p>이더리움은 탈중앙화(decentralization) 시스템이다. 시스템이 탈중앙화되기 위해서는 네트워크를 구성하는 노드 중에 가장 느린 노드 역시 다른 노드와 마찬가지로 시스템의 유효성을 검증할 수 있어야 한다. 즉 하드웨어 스펙이 낮은 컴퓨터로 네트워크가 구성이 되더라도 좋은 퍼포먼스를 낼 수 있는 프로토콜이 바로 확장성 있는(scalable) 프로토콜이라고 할 수 있을 것이다.</p>\\n<p>이 글에서는 레이어 2 솔루션인 옵티미스틱 롤업을 다룬다. 이 솔루션의 보안 모델(security model)과 이 솔루션이 어떻게 이더리움의 확장성(scalability) 문제를 해결하는지 확인할 수 있을 것이다.</p>\\n<h3>Blockchain Resource Requirements</h3>\\n<p>이더리움과 같은 탈중앙화 네트워크에서 노드를 운영하기 위해 필요한 리소스는 아래의 3가지 요소에 의해 결정된다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Bandwith</strong>: 블록체인과 관련된 데이터를 다운로드하고 전파하기 위한 비용</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Compute</strong>: 스마트 컨트랙트를 실행할 때 연산에 대한 비용</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Storage</strong>: 트랜잭션 데이터와 상태를 저장하는 비용</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>그리고 성능(performance)은 2가지 방식에 의해 측정된다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Throughput</strong>: 초당 시스템이 처리할 수 있는 트랜잭션의 수</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Latency</strong>: 하나의 트랜잭션이 처리되는데 소요되는 시간</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>비트코인과 이더리움 같은 크립토 네트워크가 추구하는 속성은 바로 <strong>탈중앙화</strong>다. 무엇이 탈중앙화를 가능하게 만드는가?</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Low Trust</strong>: 이 속성은 누구나 독립적으로 시스템의 상태를 검증할 수 있음을 말한다. 예를 들어 비트코인의 총 발행량이 2,100만개를 넘기지 않을 것이고 사람들이 사용하고 있는 비트코인이 위조되지 않은 것임을 누군가를 신뢰하지 않고도 스스로 검증할 수 있다는 것을 말한다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Low Cost</strong>: 이 속성은 노드를 운영하기 위한 비용이 높지 않아야 된다는 것이다. 노드를 운영하기 위한 비용이 많이 소요되면 개인은 결국 시스템의 상태를 검증하기 위해 다른 제3자에게 의존할 수 밖에 없어진다. <strong>즉 High Cost는 High Trust를 필요로 하게 된다.</strong>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>크립토 네트워크가 추구하는 또 다른 속성은 바로 <strong>확장성</strong>이다. 확장성이란 시스템을 운영하는 비용에 비해 처리량이나 지연시간이 월등히 나아지는 것을 말한다. 다만 이를 성취하기 위해 신뢰를 필요로 한다면 “trustless”를 추구하는 탈중앙화가 훼손될 수 있다. 그렇기 때문에 결국 신뢰를 필요로 하지 않는 <strong>탈중앙화된 확장성(decentralized scalability)</strong>을 성취해야 한다.</p>\\n<p>이더리움을 조금 더 자세히 살펴보자. 이더리움의 런타임 환경은 Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM)이고 트랜잭션은 EVM을 통해 처리된다. 트랜잭션은 다양한 연산을 수행하는데 연산별로 다른 비용이 소요된다(예를 들어 단순 더하기 연산보다 데이터를 저장하는 연산의 비용이 훨씬 비싸다). 그리고 트랜잭션의 각각의 연산을 가스라는 단위로 측정한다. 이더리움은 블록 당 최대 1,250만 가스(현재는 <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/block/12314293\">1,500만 가스 정도</a>로 유지되고 있음)를 사용하고 12.5초마다 하나의 블록이 생성되도록 시스템이 설계되어 있다. 따라서 이더리움의 지연시간는 12.5초이며 처리량은 초당 100만 가스라고 볼 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>여기서 누군가 이렇게 질문할 수도 있다. “초당 100만 가스를 가지고 이더리움에서 무엇을 할 수 있나요?” 이에 대한 대답은 다음과 같다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>단순 이더 전송을 초당 47번 할 수 있다. 단순 이더 전송에 2만 1천 가스를 필요로 한다.</li>\\n<li>ERC20 토큰 전송을 초당 16번 할 수 있다. 이는 스토리지 연산을 하기 때문에 단순 이더 전송보다 더 많은 6만 가스를 사용한다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<a href=\"https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap\">Uniswap</a> 자산 거래를 초당 10번 할 수 있다. 자산 간의 거래는 약 <a href=\"https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-periphery/blob/master/test/UniswapV2Router01.spec.ts#L369-L374\">10만 가스정도</a>를 사용한다.</li>\\n<li>이런 식으로 특정 트랜잭션의 가스 소모량을 100만으로 나눠보면 해당 트랜잭션이 최대 초당 몇번 이루어질 수 있는지 확인할 수 있다.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>여기서 주목할 점은 트랜잭션의 연산이 더 복잡해질수록 시스템의 처리량은 그만큼 감소하게 된다는 것이다. 그렇다면 이러한 문제점을 해결할 수 있는 방법은 무엇이 있을까?</p>\\n<p><strong>솔루션 1: 중개인을 이용한다.</strong></p>\\n<p>신뢰할 수 있는 제3자를 통해 트랜잭션이 처리되도록 하는 것이다. 이러한 방식으로 처리량과 지연시간의 개선이 가능하다. 하지만 이는 제3자를 신뢰할 수 밖에 없는 신뢰 모델을 채택하는 것이고 그들이 추후에 검열을 하거나 심지어 우리의 자산을 사용하지 못하게 만들 수도 있다. 이는 우리가 원하는 것이 아니다.</p>\\n<p><strong>솔루션 2: 블록을 더 크고 만들고 더 자주 생성한다.</strong></p>\\n<p>블록 생성 주기를 줄여 지연시간를 줄일 수 있고, 블록이 포함할 수 있는 가스의 양을 늘려 처리량을 늘릴 수도 있다. 하지만 이러한 변경은 노드를 운영하는데 필요한 비용을 증가시키고, 이에 따라 한 개인이 노드를 운영하는 것을 막게 된다.</p>\\n<p>솔루션 1에서는 신뢰 모델을 변경했고 솔루션 2에서는 비용를 증가시켰다. 따라서 두가지 솔루션 모두 탈중앙화를 훼손하지 않으면서 동시에 확장성을 위한 해결책이 될 수 없다.</p>\\n<h3>Rediscovering Optimistic Rollup from first principles</h3>\\n<p><em>여기서 다루는 내용은 독자들이 이미 </em><a href=\"https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-hashing/\"><em>해시(hash)</em></a><em>와 </em><a href=\"https://media.consensys.net/ever-wonder-how-merkle-trees-work-c2f8b7100ed3\"><em>머클 트리(merkle tree)</em></a><em>에 대해 이미 알고 있다고 가정한다. 그리고 아래에서 언급되는 온체인(on-chain)은 이더리움 체인을 말하고 외부체인(off-chain)은 레이어 2 체인을 말한다.</em></p>\\n<p><strong>결국 우리가 원하는 것은 탈중앙성을 훼손하지 않으면서 이더리움의 처리량을 향상시키기 위한 프로토콜을 찾는 것이다. </strong>이를 위해 “<a href=\"https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%AC%B8%EB%8B%B5%EB%B2%95\">소크라테스식 대화법</a>”으로 적절한 해답을 찾아 보자.</p>\\n<p>Q. 정리해보면 결국 신뢰나 비용의 변경없이 이더리움의 확장성 문제를 해결하고 싶은거잖아. 어떻게 해야되는 거야?</p>\\n<p>A. 우선 시스템 비용 측면(<em>위에서 언급한 3가지 타입의 리소스 참고</em>)에서 운영에 필요한 요구 사항을 낮추고 싶어. 이더리움에선 유저가 트랜잭션을 제출하면 이더리움의 모든 노드가 이를 저장하고 실행해. 트랜잭션은 EVM(Ethereum Virtual Machine)을 통해 실행되고 EVM은 상태와 상호작용하게 되지. 근데 상태와 상호작용할 때 가장 많은 비용이 들어.</p>\\n<p>Q. 그렇구나. 그럼 네가 제안하려고 하는 방식은 상태와 상호작용하는 비용을 줄이기 위한 것과 관련이 있는거야?</p>\\n<p>A. 맞았어! 내가 생각한 방식은 모든 실행을 외부체인으로 옮기고 일부 데이터만 온체인에 유지시키는 거야. <strong>시퀀서(sequencer)</strong>라고 부르는 제3자를 도입할건데, 이 시퀀서는 자신의 컴퓨터(로컬)에서 유저가 제출한 트랜잭션을 저장하고 실행하는 역할을 하게 돼. 그리고 시퀀서는 주기적으로 트랜잭션들의 머클 루트와 상태 루트를 이더리움에 제출해. 이렇게 되면 N개의 외부 트랜잭션을 1개의 이더리움 트랜잭션으로 처리할 수 있게 되는거지. 정리하면 이 솔루션은 시스템의 비용 측면에서 연산 부분의 요구사항을 낮춘거라고 볼 수 있어.</p>\\n<p>Q. 그러면 시퀀서가 모든 외부 트랜잭션을 처리하고 머클 루트만 제출하는 방식으로 확장성을 실현할 수 있다는 거야?</p>\\n<p>A. 그렇지!</p>\\n<p>Q. 그렇구나. 그러면 시퀀서가 외부에서 트랜잭션을 처리하니까 비용이 줄어들겠네. 그러면 입금이나 출금은 어떻게 할 수 있는거야?</p>\\n<p>A. 이더리움에서 입금을 하면 시퀀서는 해당 트랜잭션을 읽고 동일한 금액을 외부 체인에서 만들어 내. 그리고 유저가 외부 체인에서 이더리움으로 출금하고 싶으면, 출금 신청을 하고 외부 체인에 그만큼의 자산이 있음을 검증해줄 수 있는 증거를 제출하면 돼.</p>\\n<p>Q. 유저가 출금하고 싶은 경우 머클 증거를 만들어야 되네. 그럼 유저는 머클 증거를 어떻게 만들 수 있어?</p>\\n<p>A. 유저가 시퀀서에게 머클 증거를 만들 수 있는 데이터를 달라고 요청해야 해.</p>\\n<p>Q. 만약에 시퀀서가 그렇게 할 수 없는 상태이거나 악의적으로 데이터를 주지 않으면?</p>\\n<p>A. 그래, 그런 상황이 있을 수 있어. 이러한 상황을 <strong>데이터 가용성(data availability)</strong> 문제라고 해. 예를 들어 시퀀서가 악의적이거나 다른 문제로 오프라인 상태일 수 있지. 그렇기 때문에 시퀀서가 모든 외부 트랜잭션을 이더리움에 저장시킬 수 있도록 해야 돼. 하지만 실제로 이더리움에 제출된 트랜잭션들은 저장만 될 뿐 실행되진 않아. 이렇게 하는 이유는 데이터 가용성 문제를 해결하기 위해서야. 만약에 이더리움에 외부 트랜잭션이 영구적으로 저장되어 있다면 시퀀서가 존재하지 않아도 새로운 시퀀서가 이더리움에 있는 외부 트랜잭션을 가지고 다시 외부체인을 구성할 수 있지.</p>\\n<p>Q. 그런데, 만약 시퀀서가 온라인 상태임에도 불구하고 고의적으로 머클 증거를 전달하는 것을 거부하면 어떻게 되는거야? 내가 이더리움에서 다운로드 받으면 돼?</p>\\n<p>A. 그렇지! 네가 직접 이더리움 노드를 돌리거나 이미 돌고 있는 노드와 연결해서 시퀀서가 제출한 데이터(외부 트랜잭션)들을 가져오기만 하면 돼.</p>\\n<p>Q. 그렇구나. 근데 아직 조금 이해가 되지 않는 것이 있어. 어떻게 트랜잭션을 실행하지 않고 이더리움에 저장할 수 있는거지? 모든 트랜잭션은 EVM을 통해서 실행되는거잖아.</p>\\n<p>A. 네가 만약 A가 B에게 ETH를 전송하는 트랜잭션을 10개를 제출했다고 가정해보자. 각각의 트랜잭션은 이더리움에서 다음과 같이 행동하게 돼. A 어카운트의 논스(nonce)를 증가시키고 A의 밸런스를 감소시키고 B의 밸런스를 증가시켜. 이것만 해도 이더리움의 상태를 읽고 쓰는 행위가 필요하지. 이렇게 실행하는 것 대신에 트랜잭션 데이터를 인코딩해서 컨트랙트의 publish(bytes _transactions) public {}와 같은 함수를 호출하는거야. 컨트랙트의 함수 바디 부분이 비어있다는 것에 주목해야 돼. 이 말의 의미는 함수의 파라미터 값으로 제출된 트랜잭션들은 블록체인에 기록만 될 뿐 함수의 바디가 비어있기 때문에 실행되지 않을 뿐만 아니라 블록체인의 상태를 읽거나 쓰지 않게 돼.</p>\\n<p>Q. 그러니까 시퀀서가 외부체인에서 트랜잭션들을 실행하고 실행한 트랜잭션들을 인코딩해서 한번에 이더리움에 올린다는 거지? 그리고 트랜잭션을 실행해서 만들어진 상태 값도 이더리움에 올리는거고. 그런데 우리가 시퀀서를 믿어도 될까? 만약에 시퀀서가 잘못된 상태값을 올리면 어떻게 해?</p>\\n<p>A. 시퀀서가 상태값을 이더리움에 올릴 때마다 <strong>논쟁 기간(dispute period)</strong>이 주어지게 돼. 이 기간동안 누구나 <strong>사기 증명(fraud proof)</strong>을 제출할 수 있어. 사기 증명은 시퀀서가 올린 잘못된 상태값에 대한 증거 값들이야. 이 사기 증명을 가지고 외부 트랜잭션을 이더리움에서 재실행할 수 있어. 재실행하면 상태값이 나오고 이 상태값과 시퀀서가 제출한 상태값을 비교해. 만약 상태값이 동일하지 않으면 시퀀서가 제출한 상태값을 지우게 돼. 그러면 당연히 잘못된 상태값이 제출된 이후의 모든 상태값들도 지워지게 되겠지. 근데 만약 잘못된 상태값이 제출되었더라도 논쟁 기간이 지난 모든 트랜잭션들은 논쟁할 수 없고 확정된 상태로 남게 돼.</p>\\n<p>Q. 잠시만! 네가 아까 전에 비용을 증가시키거나 신뢰를 증가시키는 방법으로는 이더리움을 확장시킬 수 없다고 했잖아. 이런 구조에서는 사기를 신고할 수 있는 누군가 반드시 존재해야 하는거네?</p>\\n<p>A. 맞아. 그런 사람들을 <strong>검증자(verifier)</strong>라고 불러. 검증자들은 시퀀서가 제출한 상태값과 오프체인에서 만들어진 상태값을 비교해서 이 값들이 동일한지 지켜보는 역할을 하게 돼. 만약 잘못된 상태값을 시퀀서가 제출하게 되면 검증자는 사기 증명을 제출해. 정리하면 우린 검증자의 존재와 검증자가 논쟁 기간안에 사기 증명을 이더리움에 제출해줄 것이라는 가정을 하고 있는거야. 이런 검증자의 존재에 대한 가정은 약한 가정(weak assumption)이라고 볼 수 있어. 예를 들어 수천명의 유저가 앱을 쓰는데 검증자가 단 한명만 존재하면 되는거야. 반면에 신뢰 모델을 변경하거나 이더리움 노드를 운영하는 데 필요한 비용을 높이는 것은 시스템 전반적인 변경이 필요하기 때문에 강한 가정(strong assumption)이라고 볼 수 있어.</p>\\n<p>Q. 그러면 네가 말한 것처럼 검증자가 단 한명만이라도 존재하면 이 솔루션은 안전하겠네. 그럼 검증자가 되기 위해서 어떤 비용이 드는거야? 시퀀서랑 검증자가 되기 위한 요구조건이 궁금해.</p>\\n<p>A. 시퀀서와 검증자 모두 이더리움 풀노드(full node)를 돌려야 해. 동시에 외부체인 노드도 돌려서 외부체인의 상태값을 만들어내야 하지. 추가로 검증자는 사기 증명을 만들 수 있는 소프트웨어를 돌려야 하고 시퀀서는 유저의 트랜잭션과 상태값을 제출할 수 있는 소프트웨어를 돌려야 해.</p>\\n<p>대화는 여기서 끝이 난다. 위의 대화는 옵티미스틱 롤업의 컨셉에 대해 이야기를 나눈 것이다. 정리하면 다음과 같다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>옵티미스틱 롤업은 시스템의 비용 측면에서 연산 부분의 요구사항을 낮춘 것이다.</li>\\n<li>시퀀서는 유저 트랜잭션들을 외부체인에서 실행하고 상태값을 만들어 낸다. 시퀀서는 N개의 트랜잭션과 상태값을 하나의 트랜잭션으로 만들어 이더리움에 모두 제출한다.</li>\\n<li>제출된 트랜잭션들과 상태값들은 이더리움에서 실행되지 않고 저장된다.</li>\\n<li>시퀀서가 잘못된 상태값을 제출한 경우 검증자는 사기 증명을 제출한다. 사기 증명을 제출할 수 있는 별도의 기간인 논쟁 기간이 존재한다.</li>\\n<li>사기 증명을 이용해 외부 트랜잭션을 이더리움에서 재실행한다. 재실행한 트랜잭션의 상태값과 시퀀서가 제출한 상태값을 비교하는 방식으로 사기를 검증한다. 사기가 검증되면 시퀀서가 올린 상태값들은 삭제된다.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h3>Incentives in Optimistic Rollup</h3>\\n<p><strong>레이어 2 솔루션은 온체인에서 실행되는 트랜잭션의 개수를 최소화하고자 하는 것에 기반을 둔다.</strong> 옵티미스틱 롤업은 유효하지 않은 상태 변환을 막기 위해 사기 증명을 사용한다. 사기 증명 또한 온체인에서 발생하기 때문에 이더리움에 제출되는 사기 증명의 양을 최소화하고자 한다. 사기가 발생하지 않아 사기 증명이 단 한번도 제출되지 않는 것이 가장 이상적인 시나리오라고 볼 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>옵티미스틱 롤업은 시퀀서가 잘못된 상태값을 올리는 것을 막기 위해 fidelity bond를 도입했다. 유저가 시퀀서가 되기 위해서는 이더리움에 담보를 맡겨야 한다. 이후 시퀀서가 잘못된 상태값을 올리고 이것이 사기 증명을 통해 검증자의 의해 검증되면 시퀀서의 담보는 검증자에게 주어지게 된다.</p>\\n<h4>Fidelity Bonds and Dispute Periods</h4>\\n<p>사기 증명에 대한 인센티브를 디자인할 때 두 가지 변수가 존재한다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Fidelity Bond Size</strong>: 시퀀서가 되기 위한 담보물의 양으로 검증자들에게 분배된다. 이 수량이 크면 클수록 더 많은 검증자에게 검증에 대한 동기를 주게 되고, 이 수량이 작으면 작을수록 시퀀서가 잘못된 값을 올릴 동기가 높아지게 된다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Dispute Period Duration(DPD)</strong>: 사기 검증을 제출할 수 있는 기간을 말한다. 이 기간이 길면 보안 측면에서 유리하다. 하지만 이 기간이 짧으면 레이어 2에서 레이어 1으로의 출금기간이 짧아지기 때문에 유저 경험이 좋아진다. (레이어 2에서 레이어 1의 출금은 논쟁 기간 이후에 처리된다.)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>이 두가지 파라미터 값에 대한 최적의 값은 존재하지 않는다. <strong>다만 이 값들을 정하기 위해서는 반드시 검증자가 되기 위한 인센티브와 시퀀서의 패널티 둘을 고려해야 한다.</strong></p>\\n<h3>Popular Optimistic Rollup criticisms and our responses</h3>\\n<p>지금까지 옵티미스틱 롤업의 매커니즘에 대한 개괄적인 내용을 다뤘다. 이 솔루션에 대해 회의적인 의견들도 존재하는데 실제로 그것이 무엇인지 살펴보고자 한다.</p>\\n<h4>긴 출금 기간과 논쟁 기간으로 인해 실제로 사용하기 힘들고 결합성(composability)이 떨어진다.</h4>\\n<p>옵티미스틱 롤업은 사기 증명을 사용하기 때문에 논쟁 기간이 반드시 필요하다. 위에서 언급한 것처럼 논쟁 기간이 길면 보안에 유리하다. 하지만 레이어 2에서 레이어 1으로의 출금 기간이 그만큼 길어지게 된다. 이와 반대로 논쟁 기간이 짧으면 출금에 대한 유저 경험은 좋아지겠지만 사기가 발생하더라도 사기 증명이 제출되지 못할 확률은 더 높아진다.</p>\\n<p>하지만 빠른 출금 서비스를 제공해줄 수 있는 마켓 메이커가 존재한다면 위와 같은 출금 지연 문제는 큰 문제가 되지 않는다. 빠른 출금 서비스는 다음과 같이 이루어진다.</p>\\n<p>Actors:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Alice: 레이어 2에 5 ETH를 소유하고 있다.</li>\\n<li>Bob: 레이어 1에 빠른 출금을 구현한 “마켓 메이커” 컨트랙트를 배포하고 이 컨트랙트는 4.95 ETH를 소유하고 있다. 또한 레이어 2의 검증자를 돌리고 있다.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Steps:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Alice는 Bob에게 빠른 출금을 신청하고 이에 대한 수수료로 0.05 ETH를 제공하고자 한다.</li>\\n<li>Alice는 Bob의 “market maker” 컨트랙트에 출금 트랜잭션을 만들어서 보낸다.</li>\\n<li>(이후에 두가지 일이 발생할 수 있다.)</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>3–1. Bob은 이 출금이 레이어 2의 검증자를 통해 유효한 출금임을 확인하고 빠른 출금을 처리한다. 이 컨트랙트는 바로 4.95 ETH를 Alice에게 전송한다. 이후 논쟁 기간이 끝나면 Bob은 Alice의 5 ETH를 챙기고 0.05 ETH의 이득을 취한다.</p>\\n<p>3–2. Bob의 검증자가 출금 트랜잭션에 대한 상태값이 유효하지 않음을 확인한다. Bob은 잘못된 상태값에 대해 사기 증명을 제출하고 이에 대한 보상으로 시퀀서의 담보를 얻는다.</p>\\n<p>이렇게 <strong>빠른 출금이 가능해지면 출금 지연 문제를 해결할 수 있을뿐만 아니라 레이어 1 컨트랙트와의 결합성도 충족될 수 있다.</strong> 결합성이란 개별 서비스에 대한 컨트랙트를 부품으로 사용해 새로운 서비스를 만들어낼 수 있는 강력한 특징이다. 디파이(DeFi) 생태계에서는 이러한 결합성을 이용한 서비스를 제공하는 곳이 많다.</p>\\n<h4>마이너들이 뇌물을 받고 트랜잭션을 검열할 수 있기 때문에 결국 옵티미스틱 롤업의 보안성이 깨진다.</h4>\\n<p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/nearly-zero-cost-attack-scenario-on-optimistic-rollup/6336\">“Nearly-zero cost attack scenario on Optimistic Rollup”</a>의 글에서는 시퀀서와 마이너들이 공모하여 사기 증명을 제출하는 트랜잭션을 검열할 수 있다고 주장한다. 옵티미스틱 롤업은 보안을 위해 사기 증명을 사용하기 때문에 이런 일이 실제로 발생한다면 시스템에 굉장히 치명적이다.</p>\\n<p>하지만 옵티미스틱 롤업은 이 글에서 말하는 주장에 동의하지 않는다. 우선 이더리움의 마이너들은 악의적인 쪽이 아닌 정의로운 쪽에 있을 때 더 유리하다. 즉 마이너가 시퀀서로부터 뇌물을 받고 트랜잭션을 검열하게 되면 이는 결국 이더리움의 가치를 훼손시키는 행위가 될 것이고 마이너는 더 큰 손실을 입게 될 것이라는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>실제로 이러한 시나리오를 연구한 <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10736.pdf\">논문</a>이 존재한다. 이 논문에서는 <strong>이러한 공격은 부분게임 완전 균형을 유도하고 결국 어떤 공격도 처음부터 하지 않는 것이 마이너에게 가장 유리하다</strong>는 내용을 담고 있다. 우선 용어 설명이 필요해 보인다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>순차적 게임</strong>: 다른 플레이어가 행동을 정하기 전에 먼저 행동을 결정하는 게임으로 내가 행동하기 이전의 다른 사람의 행동이 자신의 이득을 위한 행동에 힌트가 될 수 있다. 예를 들어 체스가 순차적 게임이라고 볼 수 있다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>내쉬 균형</strong>: 게임 이론에서 경쟁자의 대응에 따라 서로가 최선의 선택을 했을 때 자신의 선택을 바꾸지 않는 균형 상태에 이르는 것을 말한다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>부분게임 완전 균형</strong>: 게임 전체의 모든 부분 게임이 내쉬 균형이 되는 전략을 말한다. 이러한 부분게임 완전 균형을 찾기 위해서는 역진 귀납법을 사용한다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>역진 귀납법</strong>: 게임의 가장 마지막 행위자가 자기의 효용을 극대화하기 위해 어떤 행위를 할 것인지를 먼저 고려하고, 바로 앞 행위자는 뒤의 행위자가 할 선택을 고려하여 자신의 효용을 극대화하는 전략을 선택하는 방식을 말한다. 이런 과정을 맨 처음 행위자에 이를 때까지 계속한다.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>시퀀서와 마이너가 담합을 하게 되는 시나리오를 가정했을 때 역진 귀납법을 사용해보면 결국 처음부터 시퀀서와 담합을 하지 않는 것이 마이너에게 가장 유리한 선택임을 말해준다.</p>\\n<h4>검증자의 딜레마(Verifier’s Dilemma)로 인해 검증자를 운영할 요인을 없애고 이로 인해 옵티미스틱 롤업의 보안성이 깨진다.</h4>\\n<p>검증자의 딜레마는 다음과 같이 요약할 수 있다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>시스템의 인센티브가 의도한 대로 잘 동작한다면 누구도 악의적인 행위를 하지 않을 것이다.</li>\\n<li>누구도 악의적인 행위를 하지 않으면, 검증자를 운영할 요인이 없어진다. 왜냐하면 검증자는 시퀀서의 악의적인 행위를 발견하고 검증하는 것으로부터 보상을 받기 때문이다.</li>\\n<li>누구도 검증자를 운영하지 않으면 결국 시퀀서는 악의적인 행위를 할 요인이 충분히 생긴다.</li>\\n<li>결국 시퀀서는 악의적인 행위를 하고 시스템은 의도한 대로 동작하지 않게 된다.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>검증자의 딜레마는 딜레마라고 부르는 것만큼 해결하기 어려운 문제다. 하지만 옵티미스틱 롤업은 검증자의 딜레마를 해결해야 하는 문제로 바라보지 않는다. 실제로 검증자가 되기 위한 인센티브로 금전적인 것과 관련이 없는 것도 존재한다. 예를 들어 누군가 레이어 2에서 디앱(dApp, Decentralized Application)을 운영하거나 레이어 2에 토큰을 많이 가지고 있다면, 그 사람은 디앱이 정상적으로 동작하도록 또는 자신의 토큰을 지키기 위해 검증자를 운영할 것이다. 그리고 빠른 출금(이전 섹션에서 다루었음)을 하기 위해서는 검증자를 반드시 운영해야 하기 때문에 빠른 출금에 대한 수요가 존재한다면 검증자는 반드시 존재할 것이다. 심지어 비트코인은 블록체인 데이터를 저장하고 피어에게 데이터를 제공해주는 것에 대한 인센티브가 없는데도 불구하고 사람들은 이타적으로 블록체인 노드를 운영한다.</p>\\n<p>검증자를 돌리기 위한 인센티브가 존재하지 않다고 하더라도 이 시스템의 성공을 바라는 사람들은 검증자를 돌릴 것이기 때문에 이 시스템은 안전하다고 볼 수 있다. 따라서 <strong>옵티미스틱 롤업은 검증자의 딜레마를 위한 디자인 매커니즘 설계를 전혀 하지 않았다.</strong></p>\\n<blockquote>이 글은 옵티미스틱 롤업에서 검증자를 운영할 유인이 충분하다고 가정하며, 검증자의 딜레마는 크게 문제가 되지 않을 것이라 보고 있다. 하지만, 이러한 관점은 롤업을 장기적으로 안전하게 운영하는데 있어서 큰 위협이 될 수 있다. 이에 관해 온더에서는 롤업에서 검증자의 딜레마를 고려하지 않을 경우 어떠한 문제가 발생할 수 있는지, 또 어떻게 이를 해결할 수 있는지를 분석하였다. 자세한 내용은 <a href=\"https://medium.com/onther-tech/optimistic-rollup-is-not-secure-enough-than-you-think-46bf93d80292\">여기</a>서 확인할

제약(e.g. CPU, bandwidth, memory, disk space) 하에 <strong>짧은 지연시간(low latency)과</strong> <strong>빠른 처리량(high throughput)</strong>을 가지도록 하는데에 많은 노력을 들이고 있다.</p>\\n<p>이더리움은 탈중앙화(decentralization) 시스템이다. 시스템이 탈중앙화되기 위해서는 네트워크를 구성하는 노드 중에 가장 느린 노드 역시 다른 노드와 마찬가지로 시스템의 유효성을 검증할 수 있어야 한다. 즉 하드웨어 스펙이 낮은 컴퓨터로 네트워크가 구성이 되더라도 좋은 퍼포먼스를 낼 수 있는 프로토콜이 바로 확장성 있는(scalable) 프로토콜이라고 할 수 있을 것이다.</p>\\n<p>이 글에서는 레이어 2 솔루션인 옵티미스틱 롤업을 다룬다. 이 솔루션의 보안 모델(security model)과 이 솔루션이 어떻게 이더리움의 확장성(scalability) 문제를 해결하는지 확인할 수 있을 것이다.</p>\\n<h3>Blockchain Resource Requirements</h3>\\n<p>이더리움과 같은 탈중앙화 네트워크에서 노드를 운영하기 위해 필요한 리소스는 아래의 3가지 요소에 의해 결정된다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Bandwith</strong>: 블록체인과 관련된 데이터를 다운로드하고 전파하기 위한 비용</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Compute</strong>: 스마트 컨트랙트를 실행할 때 연산에 대한 비용</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Storage</strong>: 트랜잭션 데이터와 상태를 저장하는 비용</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>그리고 성능(performance)은 2가지 방식에 의해 측정된다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Throughput</strong>: 초당 시스템이 처리할 수 있는 트랜잭션의 수</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Latency</strong>: 하나의 트랜잭션이 처리되는데 소요되는 시간</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>비트코인과 이더리움 같은 크립토 네트워크가 추구하는 속성은 바로 <strong>탈중앙화</strong>다. 무엇이 탈중앙화를 가능하게 만드는가?</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Low Trust</strong>: 이 속성은 누구나 독립적으로 시스템의 상태를 검증할 수 있음을 말한다. 예를 들어 비트코인의 총 발행량이 2,100만개를 넘기지 않을 것이고 사람들이 사용하고 있는 비트코인이 위조되지 않은 것임을 누군가를 신뢰하지 않고도 스스로 검증할 수 있다는 것을 말한다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Low Cost</strong>: 이 속성은 노드를 운영하기 위한 비용이 높지 않아야 된다는 것이다. 노드를 운영하기 위한 비용이 많이 소요되면 개인은 결국 시스템의 상태를 검증하기 위해 다른 제3자에게 의존할 수 밖에 없어진다. <strong>즉 High Cost는 High Trust를 필요로 하게 된다.</strong>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>크립토 네트워크가 추구하는 또 다른 속성은 바로 <strong>확장성</strong>이다. 확장성이란 시스템을 운영하는 비용에 비해 처리량이나 지연시간이 월등히 나아지는 것을 말한다. 다만 이를 성취하기 위해 신뢰를 필요로 한다면 “trustless”를 추구하는 탈중앙화가 훼손될 수 있다. 그렇기 때문에 결국 신뢰를 필요로 하지 않는 <strong>탈중앙화된 확장성(decentralized scalability)</strong>을 성취해야 한다.</p>\\n<p>이더리움을 조금 더 자세히 살펴보자. 이더리움의 런타임 환경은 Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM)이고 트랜잭션은 EVM을 통해 처리된다. 트랜잭션은 다양한 연산을 수행하는데 연산별로 다른 비용이 소요된다(예를 들어 단순 더하기 연산보다 데이터를 저장하는 연산의 비용이 훨씬 비싸다). 그리고 트랜잭션의 각각의 연산을 가스라는 단위로 측정한다. 이더리움은 블록 당 최대 1,250만 가스(현재는 <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/block/12314293\">1,500만 가스 정도</a>로 유지되고 있음)를 사용하고 12.5초마다 하나의 블록이 생성되도록 시스템이 설계되어 있다. 따라서 이더리움의 지연시간는 12.5초이며 처리량은 초당 100만 가스라고 볼 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>여기서 누군가 이렇게 질문할 수도 있다. “초당 100만 가스를 가지고 이더리움에서 무엇을 할 수 있나요?” 이에 대한 대답은 다음과 같다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>단순 이더 전송을 초당 47번 할 수 있다. 단순 이더 전송에 2만 1천 가스를 필요로 한다.</li>\\n<li>ERC20 토큰 전송을 초당 16번 할 수 있다. 이는 스토리지 연산을 하기 때문에 단순 이더 전송보다 더 많은 6만 가스를 사용한다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<a href=\"https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap\">Uniswap</a> 자산 거래를 초당 10번 할 수 있다. 자산 간의 거래는 약 <a href=\"https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-periphery/blob/master/test/UniswapV2Router01.spec.ts#L369-L374\">10만 가스정도</a>를 사용한다.</li>\\n<li>이런 식으로 특정 트랜잭션의 가스 소모량을 100만으로 나눠보면 해당 트랜잭션이 최대 초당 몇번 이루어질 수 있는지 확인할 수 있다.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>여기서 주목할 점은 트랜잭션의 연산이 더 복잡해질수록 시스템의 처리량은 그만큼 감소하게 된다는 것이다. 그렇다면 이러한 문제점을 해결할 수 있는 방법은 무엇이 있을까?</p>\\n<p><strong>솔루션 1: 중개인을 이용한다.</strong></p>\\n<p>신뢰할 수 있는 제3자를 통해 트랜잭션이 처리되도록 하는 것이다. 이러한 방식으로 처리량과 지연시간의 개선이 가능하다. 하지만 이는 제3자를 신뢰할 수 밖에 없는 신뢰 모델을 채택하는 것이고 그들이 추후에 검열을 하거나 심지어 우리의 자산을 사용하지 못하게 만들 수도 있다. 이는 우리가 원하는 것이 아니다.</p>\\n<p><strong>솔루션 2: 블록을 더 크고 만들고 더 자주 생성한다.</strong></p>\\n<p>블록 생성 주기를 줄여 지연시간를 줄일 수 있고, 블록이 포함할 수 있는 가스의 양을 늘려 처리량을 늘릴 수도 있다. 하지만 이러한 변경은 노드를 운영하는데 필요한 비용을 증가시키고, 이에 따라 한 개인이 노드를 운영하는 것을 막게 된다.</p>\\n<p>솔루션 1에서는 신뢰 모델을 변경했고 솔루션 2에서는 비용를 증가시켰다. 따라서 두가지 솔루션 모두 탈중앙화를 훼손하지 않으면서 동시에 확장성을 위한 해결책이 될 수 없다.</p>\\n<h3>Rediscovering Optimistic Rollup from first principles</h3>\\n<p><em>여기서 다루는 내용은 독자들이 이미 </em><a href=\"https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-hashing/\"><em>해시(hash)</em></a><em>와 </em><a href=\"https://media.consensys.net/ever-wonder-how-merkle-trees-work-c2f8b7100ed3\"><em>머클 트리(merkle tree)</em></a><em>에 대해 이미 알고 있다고 가정한다. 그리고 아래에서 언급되는 온체인(on-chain)은 이더리움 체인을 말하고 외부체인(off-chain)은 레이어 2 체인을 말한다.</em></p>\\n<p><strong>결국 우리가 원하는 것은 탈중앙성을 훼손하지 않으면서 이더리움의 처리량을 향상시키기 위한 프로토콜을 찾는 것이다. </strong>이를 위해 “<a href=\"https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%AC%B8%EB%8B%B5%EB%B2%95\">소크라테스식 대화법</a>”으로 적절한 해답을 찾아 보자.</p>\\n<p>Q. 정리해보면 결국 신뢰나 비용의 변경없이 이더리움의 확장성 문제를 해결하고 싶은거잖아. 어떻게 해야되는 거야?</p>\\n<p>A. 우선 시스템 비용 측면(<em>위에서 언급한 3가지 타입의 리소스 참고</em>)에서 운영에 필요한 요구 사항을 낮추고 싶어. 이더리움에선 유저가 트랜잭션을 제출하면 이더리움의 모든 노드가 이를 저장하고 실행해. 트랜잭션은 EVM(Ethereum Virtual Machine)을 통해 실행되고 EVM은 상태와 상호작용하게 되지. 근데 상태와 상호작용할 때 가장 많은 비용이 들어.</p>\\n<p>Q. 그렇구나. 그럼 네가 제안하려고 하는 방식은 상태와 상호작용하는 비용을 줄이기 위한 것과 관련이 있는거야?</p>\\n<p>A. 맞았어! 내가 생각한 방식은 모든 실행을 외부체인으로 옮기고 일부 데이터만 온체인에 유지시키는 거야. <strong>시퀀서(sequencer)</strong>라고 부르는 제3자를 도입할건데, 이 시퀀서는 자신의 컴퓨터(로컬)에서 유저가 제출한 트랜잭션을 저장하고 실행하는 역할을 하게 돼. 그리고 시퀀서는 주기적으로 트랜잭션들의 머클 루트와 상태 루트를 이더리움에 제출해. 이렇게 되면 N개의 외부 트랜잭션을 1개의 이더리움 트랜잭션으로 처리할 수 있게 되는거지. 정리하면 이 솔루션은 시스템의 비용 측면에서 연산 부분의 요구사항을 낮춘거라고 볼 수 있어.</p>\\n<p>Q. 그러면 시퀀서가 모든 외부 트랜잭션을 처리하고 머클 루트만 제출하는 방식으로 확장성을 실현할 수 있다는 거야?</p>\\n<p>A. 그렇지!</p>\\n<p>Q. 그렇구나. 그러면 시퀀서가 외부에서 트랜잭션을 처리하니까 비용이 줄어들겠네. 그러면 입금이나 출금은 어떻게 할 수 있는거야?</p>\\n<p>A. 이더리움에서 입금을 하면 시퀀서는 해당 트랜잭션을 읽고 동일한 금액을 외부 체인에서 만들어 내. 그리고 유저가 외부 체인에서 이더리움으로 출금하고 싶으면, 출금 신청을 하고 외부 체인에 그만큼의 자산이 있음을 검증해줄 수 있는 증거를 제출하면 돼.</p>\\n<p>Q. 유저가 출금하고 싶은 경우 머클 증거를 만들어야 되네. 그럼 유저는 머클 증거를 어떻게 만들 수 있어?</p>\\n<p>A. 유저가 시퀀서에게 머클 증거를 만들 수 있는 데이터를 달라고 요청해야 해.</p>\\n<p>Q. 만약에 시퀀서가 그렇게 할 수 없는 상태이거나 악의적으로 데이터를 주지 않으면?</p>\\n<p>A. 그래, 그런 상황이 있을 수 있어. 이러한 상황을 <strong>데이터 가용성(data availability)</strong> 문제라고 해. 예를 들어 시퀀서가 악의적이거나 다른 문제로 오프라인 상태일 수 있지. 그렇기 때문에 시퀀서가 모든 외부 트랜잭션을 이더리움에 저장시킬 수 있도록 해야 돼. 하지만 실제로 이더리움에 제출된 트랜잭션들은 저장만 될 뿐 실행되진 않아. 이렇게 하는 이유는 데이터 가용성 문제를 해결하기 위해서야. 만약에 이더리움에 외부 트랜잭션이 영구적으로 저장되어 있다면 시퀀서가 존재하지 않아도 새로운 시퀀서가 이더리움에 있는 외부 트랜잭션을 가지고 다시 외부체인을 구성할 수 있지.</p>\\n<p>Q. 그런데, 만약 시퀀서가 온라인 상태임에도 불구하고 고의적으로 머클 증거를 전달하는 것을 거부하면 어떻게 되는거야? 내가 이더리움에서 다운로드 받으면 돼?</p>\\n<p>A. 그렇지! 네가 직접 이더리움 노드를 돌리거나 이미 돌고 있는 노드와 연결해서 시퀀서가 제출한 데이터(외부 트랜잭션)들을 가져오기만 하면 돼.</p>\\n<p>Q. 그렇구나. 근데 아직 조금 이해가 되지 않는 것이 있어. 어떻게 트랜잭션을 실행하지 않고 이더리움에 저장할 수 있는거지? 모든 트랜잭션은 EVM을 통해서 실행되는거잖아.</p>\\n<p>A. 네가 만약 A가 B에게 ETH를 전송하는 트랜잭션을 10개를 제출했다고 가정해보자. 각각의 트랜잭션은 이더리움에서 다음과 같이 행동하게 돼. A 어카운트의 논스(nonce)를 증가시키고 A의 밸런스를 감소시키고 B의 밸런스를 증가시켜. 이것만 해도 이더리움의 상태를 읽고 쓰는 행위가 필요하지. 이렇게 실행하는 것 대신에 트랜잭션 데이터를 인코딩해서 컨트랙트의 publish(bytes _transactions) public {}와 같은 함수를 호출하는거야. 컨트랙트의 함수 바디 부분이 비어있다는 것에 주목해야 돼. 이 말의 의미는 함수의 파라미터 값으로 제출된 트랜잭션들은 블록체인에 기록만 될 뿐 함수의 바디가 비어있기 때문에 실행되지 않을 뿐만 아니라 블록체인의 상태를 읽거나 쓰지 않게 돼.</p>\\n<p>Q. 그러니까 시퀀서가 외부체인에서 트랜잭션들을 실행하고 실행한 트랜잭션들을 인코딩해서 한번에 이더리움에 올린다는 거지? 그리고 트랜잭션을 실행해서 만들어진 상태 값도 이더리움에 올리는거고. 그런데 우리가 시퀀서를 믿어도 될까? 만약에 시퀀서가 잘못된 상태값을 올리면 어떻게 해?</p>\\n<p>A. 시퀀서가 상태값을 이더리움에 올릴 때마다 <strong>논쟁 기간(dispute period)</strong>이 주어지게 돼. 이 기간동안 누구나 <strong>사기 증명(fraud proof)</strong>을 제출할 수 있어. 사기 증명은 시퀀서가 올린 잘못된 상태값에 대한 증거 값들이야. 이 사기 증명을 가지고 외부 트랜잭션을 이더리움에서 재실행할 수 있어. 재실행하면 상태값이 나오고 이 상태값과 시퀀서가 제출한 상태값을 비교해. 만약 상태값이 동일하지 않으면 시퀀서가 제출한 상태값을 지우게 돼. 그러면 당연히 잘못된 상태값이 제출된 이후의 모든 상태값들도 지워지게 되겠지. 근데 만약 잘못된 상태값이 제출되었더라도 논쟁 기간이 지난 모든 트랜잭션들은 논쟁할 수 없고 확정된 상태로 남게 돼.</p>\\n<p>Q. 잠시만! 네가 아까 전에 비용을 증가시키거나 신뢰를 증가시키는 방법으로는 이더리움을 확장시킬 수 없다고 했잖아. 이런 구조에서는 사기를 신고할 수 있는 누군가 반드시 존재해야 하는거네?</p>\\n<p>A. 맞아. 그런 사람들을 <strong>검증자(verifier)</strong>라고 불러. 검증자들은 시퀀서가 제출한 상태값과 오프체인에서 만들어진 상태값을 비교해서 이 값들이 동일한지 지켜보는 역할을 하게 돼. 만약 잘못된 상태값을 시퀀서가 제출하게 되면 검증자는 사기 증명을 제출해. 정리하면 우린 검증자의 존재와 검증자가 논쟁 기간안에 사기 증명을 이더리움에 제출해줄 것이라는 가정을 하고 있는거야. 이런 검증자의 존재에 대한 가정은 약한 가정(weak assumption)이라고 볼 수 있어. 예를 들어 수천명의 유저가 앱을 쓰는데 검증자가 단 한명만 존재하면 되는거야. 반면에 신뢰 모델을 변경하거나 이더리움 노드를 운영하는 데 필요한 비용을 높이는 것은 시스템 전반적인 변경이 필요하기 때문에 강한 가정(strong assumption)이라고 볼 수 있어.</p>\\n<p>Q. 그러면 네가 말한 것처럼 검증자가 단 한명만이라도 존재하면 이 솔루션은 안전하겠네. 그럼 검증자가 되기 위해서 어떤 비용이 드는거야? 시퀀서랑 검증자가 되기 위한 요구조건이 궁금해.</p>\\n<p>A. 시퀀서와 검증자 모두 이더리움 풀노드(full node)를 돌려야 해. 동시에 외부체인 노드도 돌려서 외부체인의 상태값을 만들어내야 하지. 추가로 검증자는 사기 증명을 만들 수 있는 소프트웨어를 돌려야 하고 시퀀서는 유저의 트랜잭션과 상태값을 제출할 수 있는 소프트웨어를 돌려야 해.</p>\\n<p>대화는 여기서 끝이 난다. 위의 대화는 옵티미스틱 롤업의 컨셉에 대해 이야기를 나눈 것이다. 정리하면 다음과 같다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>옵티미스틱 롤업은 시스템의 비용 측면에서 연산 부분의 요구사항을 낮춘 것이다.</li>\\n<li>시퀀서는 유저 트랜잭션들을 외부체인에서 실행하고 상태값을 만들어 낸다. 시퀀서는 N개의 트랜잭션과 상태값을 하나의 트랜잭션으로 만들어 이더리움에 모두 제출한다.</li>\\n<li>제출된 트랜잭션들과 상태값들은 이더리움에서 실행되지 않고 저장된다.</li>\\n<li>시퀀서가 잘못된 상태값을 제출한 경우 검증자는 사기 증명을 제출한다. 사기 증명을 제출할 수 있는 별도의 기간인 논쟁 기간이 존재한다.</li>\\n<li>사기 증명을 이용해 외부 트랜잭션을 이더리움에서 재실행한다. 재실행한 트랜잭션의 상태값과 시퀀서가 제출한 상태값을 비교하는 방식으로 사기를 검증한다. 사기가 검증되면 시퀀서가 올린 상태값들은 삭제된다.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h3>Incentives in Optimistic Rollup</h3>\\n<p><strong>레이어 2 솔루션은 온체인에서 실행되는 트랜잭션의 개수를 최소화하고자 하는 것에 기반을 둔다.</strong> 옵티미스틱 롤업은 유효하지 않은 상태 변환을 막기 위해 사기 증명을 사용한다. 사기 증명 또한 온체인에서 발생하기 때문에 이더리움에 제출되는 사기 증명의 양을 최소화하고자 한다. 사기가 발생하지 않아 사기 증명이 단 한번도 제출되지 않는 것이 가장 이상적인 시나리오라고 볼 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>옵티미스틱 롤업은 시퀀서가 잘못된 상태값을 올리는 것을 막기 위해 fidelity bond를 도입했다. 유저가 시퀀서가 되기 위해서는 이더리움에 담보를 맡겨야 한다. 이후 시퀀서가 잘못된 상태값을 올리고 이것이 사기 증명을 통해 검증자의 의해 검증되면 시퀀서의 담보는 검증자에게 주어지게 된다.</p>\\n<h4>Fidelity Bonds and Dispute Periods</h4>\\n<p>사기 증명에 대한 인센티브를 디자인할 때 두 가지 변수가 존재한다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Fidelity Bond Size</strong>: 시퀀서가 되기 위한 담보물의 양으로 검증자들에게 분배된다. 이 수량이 크면 클수록 더 많은 검증자에게 검증에 대한 동기를 주게 되고, 이 수량이 작으면 작을수록 시퀀서가 잘못된 값을 올릴 동기가 높아지게 된다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Dispute Period Duration(DPD)</strong>: 사기 검증을 제출할 수 있는 기간을 말한다. 이 기간이 길면 보안 측면에서 유리하다. 하지만 이 기간이 짧으면 레이어 2에서 레이어 1으로의 출금기간이 짧아지기 때문에 유저 경험이 좋아진다. (레이어 2에서 레이어 1의 출금은 논쟁 기간 이후에 처리된다.)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>이 두가지 파라미터 값에 대한 최적의 값은 존재하지 않는다. <strong>다만 이 값들을 정하기 위해서는 반드시 검증자가 되기 위한 인센티브와 시퀀서의 패널티 둘을 고려해야 한다.</strong></p>\\n<h3>Popular Optimistic Rollup criticisms and our responses</h3>\\n<p>지금까지 옵티미스틱 롤업의 매커니즘에 대한 개괄적인 내용을 다뤘다. 이 솔루션에 대해 회의적인 의견들도 존재하는데 실제로 그것이 무엇인지 살펴보고자 한다.</p>\\n<h4>긴 출금 기간과 논쟁 기간으로 인해 실제로 사용하기 힘들고 결합성(composability)이 떨어진다.</h4>\\n<p>옵티미스틱 롤업은 사기 증명을 사용하기 때문에 논쟁 기간이 반드시 필요하다. 위에서 언급한 것처럼 논쟁 기간이 길면 보안에 유리하다. 하지만 레이어 2에서 레이어 1으로의 출금 기간이 그만큼 길어지게 된다. 이와 반대로 논쟁 기간이 짧으면 출금에 대한 유저 경험은 좋아지겠지만 사기가 발생하더라도 사기 증명이 제출되지 못할 확률은 더 높아진다.</p>\\n<p>하지만 빠른 출금 서비스를 제공해줄 수 있는 마켓 메이커가 존재한다면 위와 같은 출금 지연 문제는 큰 문제가 되지 않는다. 빠른 출금 서비스는 다음과 같이 이루어진다.</p>\\n<p>Actors:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Alice: 레이어 2에 5 ETH를 소유하고 있다.</li>\\n<li>Bob: 레이어 1에 빠른 출금을 구현한 “마켓 메이커” 컨트랙트를 배포하고 이 컨트랙트는 4.95 ETH를 소유하고 있다. 또한 레이어 2의 검증자를 돌리고 있다.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Steps:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Alice는 Bob에게 빠른 출금을 신청하고 이에 대한 수수료로 0.05 ETH를 제공하고자 한다.</li>\\n<li>Alice는 Bob의 “market maker” 컨트랙트에 출금 트랜잭션을 만들어서 보낸다.</li>\\n<li>(이후에 두가지 일이 발생할 수 있다.)</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>3–1. Bob은 이 출금이 레이어 2의 검증자를 통해 유효한 출금임을 확인하고 빠른 출금을 처리한다. 이 컨트랙트는 바로 4.95 ETH를 Alice에게 전송한다. 이후 논쟁 기간이 끝나면 Bob은 Alice의 5 ETH를 챙기고 0.05 ETH의 이득을 취한다.</p>\\n<p>3–2. Bob의 검증자가 출금 트랜잭션에 대한 상태값이 유효하지 않음을 확인한다. Bob은 잘못된 상태값에 대해 사기 증명을 제출하고 이에 대한 보상으로 시퀀서의 담보를 얻는다.</p>\\n<p>이렇게 <strong>빠른 출금이 가능해지면 출금 지연 문제를 해결할 수 있을뿐만 아니라 레이어 1 컨트랙트와의 결합성도 충족될 수 있다.</strong> 결합성이란 개별 서비스에 대한 컨트랙트를 부품으로 사용해 새로운 서비스를 만들어낼 수 있는 강력한 특징이다. 디파이(DeFi) 생태계에서는 이러한 결합성을 이용한 서비스를 제공하는 곳이 많다.</p>\\n<h4>마이너들이 뇌물을 받고 트랜잭션을 검열할 수 있기 때문에 결국 옵티미스틱 롤업의 보안성이 깨진다.</h4>\\n<p><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/nearly-zero-cost-attack-scenario-on-optimistic-rollup/6336\">“Nearly-zero cost attack scenario on Optimistic Rollup”</a>의 글에서는 시퀀서와 마이너들이 공모하여 사기 증명을 제출하는 트랜잭션을 검열할 수 있다고 주장한다. 옵티미스틱 롤업은 보안을 위해 사기 증명을 사용하기 때문에 이런 일이 실제로 발생한다면 시스템에 굉장히 치명적이다.</p>\\n<p>하지만 옵티미스틱 롤업은 이 글에서 말하는 주장에 동의하지 않는다. 우선 이더리움의 마이너들은 악의적인 쪽이 아닌 정의로운 쪽에 있을 때 더 유리하다. 즉 마이너가 시퀀서로부터 뇌물을 받고 트랜잭션을 검열하게 되면 이는 결국 이더리움의 가치를 훼손시키는 행위가 될 것이고 마이너는 더 큰 손실을 입게 될 것이라는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>실제로 이러한 시나리오를 연구한 <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10736.pdf\">논문</a>이 존재한다. 이 논문에서는 <strong>이러한 공격은 부분게임 완전 균형을 유도하고 결국 어떤 공격도 처음부터 하지 않는 것이 마이너에게 가장 유리하다</strong>는 내용을 담고 있다. 우선 용어 설명이 필요해 보인다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>순차적 게임</strong>: 다른 플레이어가 행동을 정하기 전에 먼저 행동을 결정하는 게임으로 내가 행동하기 이전의 다른 사람의 행동이 자신의 이득을 위한 행동에 힌트가 될 수 있다. 예를 들어 체스가 순차적 게임이라고 볼 수 있다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>내쉬 균형</strong>: 게임 이론에서 경쟁자의 대응에 따라 서로가 최선의 선택을 했을 때 자신의 선택을 바꾸지 않는 균형 상태에 이르는 것을 말한다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>부분게임 완전 균형</strong>: 게임 전체의 모든 부분 게임이 내쉬 균형이 되는 전략을 말한다. 이러한 부분게임 완전 균형을 찾기 위해서는 역진 귀납법을 사용한다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>역진 귀납법</strong>: 게임의 가장 마지막 행위자가 자기의 효용을 극대화하기 위해 어떤 행위를 할 것인지를 먼저 고려하고, 바로 앞 행위자는 뒤의 행위자가 할 선택을 고려하여 자신의 효용을 극대화하는 전략을 선택하는 방식을 말한다. 이런 과정을 맨 처음 행위자에 이를 때까지 계속한다.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>시퀀서와 마이너가 담합을 하게 되는 시나리오를 가정했을 때 역진 귀납법을 사용해보면 결국 처음부터 시퀀서와 담합을 하지 않는 것이 마이너에게 가장 유리한 선택임을 말해준다.</p>\\n<h4>검증자의 딜레마(Verifier’s Dilemma)로 인해 검증자를 운영할 요인을 없애고 이로 인해 옵티미스틱 롤업의 보안성이 깨진다.</h4>\\n<p>검증자의 딜레마는 다음과 같이 요약할 수 있다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>시스템의 인센티브가 의도한 대로 잘 동작한다면 누구도 악의적인 행위를 하지 않을 것이다.</li>\\n<li>누구도 악의적인 행위를 하지 않으면, 검증자를 운영할 요인이 없어진다. 왜냐하면 검증자는 시퀀서의 악의적인 행위를 발견하고 검증하는 것으로부터 보상을 받기 때문이다.</li>\\n<li>누구도 검증자를 운영하지 않으면 결국 시퀀서는 악의적인 행위를 할 요인이 충분히 생긴다.</li>\\n<li>결국 시퀀서는 악의적인 행위를 하고 시스템은 의도한 대로 동작하지 않게 된다.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>검증자의 딜레마는 딜레마라고 부르는 것만큼 해결하기 어려운 문제다. 하지만 옵티미스틱 롤업은 검증자의 딜레마를 해결해야 하는 문제로 바라보지 않는다. 실제로 검증자가 되기 위한 인센티브로 금전적인 것과 관련이 없는 것도 존재한다. 예를 들어 누군가 레이어 2에서 디앱(dApp, Decentralized Application)을 운영하거나 레이어 2에 토큰을 많이 가지고 있다면, 그 사람은 디앱이 정상적으로 동작하도록 또는 자신의 토큰을 지키기 위해 검증자를 운영할 것이다. 그리고 빠른 출금(이전 섹션에서 다루었음)을 하기 위해서는 검증자를 반드시 운영해야 하기 때문에 빠른 출금에 대한 수요가 존재한다면 검증자는 반드시 존재할 것이다. 심지어 비트코인은 블록체인 데이터를 저장하고 피어에게 데이터를 제공해주는 것에 대한 인센티브가 없는데도 불구하고 사람들은 이타적으로 블록체인 노드를 운영한다.</p>\\n<p>검증자를 돌리기 위한 인센티브가 존재하지 않다고 하더라도 이 시스템의 성공을 바라는 사람들은 검증자를 돌릴 것이기 때문에 이 시스템은 안전하다고 볼 수 있다. 따라서 <strong>옵티미스틱 롤업은 검증자의 딜레마를 위한 디자인 매커니즘 설계를 전혀 하지 않았다.</strong></p>\\n<blockquote>이 글은 옵티미스틱 롤업에서 검증자를 운영할 유인이 충분하다고 가정하며, 검증자의 딜레마는 크게 문제가 되지 않을 것이라 보고 있다. 하지만, 이러한 관점은 롤업을 장기적으로 안전하게 운영하는데 있어서 큰 위협이 될 수 있다. 이에 관해 온더에서는 롤업에서 검증자의 딜레마를 고려하지 않을 경우 어떠한 문제가 발생할 수 있는지, 또 어떻게 이를 해결할 수 있는지를 분석하였다. 자세한 내용은 <a href=\"https://medium.com/onther-tech/optimistic-rollup-is-not-secure-enough-than-you-think-46bf93d80292\">여기</a>서 확인할 수 있다.</blockquote>\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\n<p>우리는 옵티미스틱 롤업과 인센티브 구조 그리고 이 솔루션에 대한 회의적인 관점에 대한 대답도 들어볼 수 있었다. 옵티미스틱 롤업은 2019년부터 연구된 확장성 솔루션들 중에서도 현재 적용할 수 있는 가장 적합한 솔루션으로 평가 받고 있다.</p>\\n<p>옵티미스틱 롤업 개발은 옵티미즘 팀이 가장 선두적으로 진행하고 있다. 다음 포스팅은 옵티미즘 팀이 개발하고 있는 <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism\">Optimism</a>에 대해 심도있게 다뤄보려고 한다.</p>\\n<h4>Reference</h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a

또 이를 활용하여 우리는 어떠한 가치를 만들어 낼 수 있는지에 대해 깊이 논의한다. 기술적인 논의보다는 사회 경제적인 논의가 주를 이루기 때문에, 블록체인에 관심이 있는 독자라면 누구나 쉽게 이 글을 이해할 수 있을 것이다.</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>이 글에서는 ‘Legitimacy’를 정당성으로 번역 하였는데, 실제로 이 글에서 다루는 ‘Legitimacy’ 는 ‘정당성’ 이외에도 ‘진짜인 것, 진품’ 등의 다양한 의미를 갖는다. 따라서, 이를 문자 그대로 받아들이기 보다, 행간을 통해 그 의미를 파악하는것을 권장한다.</blockquote>\\n<h3>들어가며</h3>\\n<p><em>Special thanks to Karl Floersch, Aya Miyaguchi and Mr Silly for ideas, feedback and review.</em></p>\\n<p>비트코인과 이더리움 블록체인 생태계는 작업증명 마이닝의 목적인 네트워크 안전성(security)을 위해 다른 모든 분야에 투입되는 것보다 훨씬 더 많은 양의 자원을 쏟아붓고 있다. 비트코인은 연초부터 하루 평균 약 3800만 달러의 블록 보상과 <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_total_transaction_fees_per_day\">약 500만 달러의 거래 수수료</a>를 마이너들에게 지급하고있다. 이더리움은 하루 1950만 달러의 블록 보상과 1800만 달러의 트랜잭션 수수료를 지급하고 있으며 이는 비트코인 다음으로 많은 양이다. 반면에, 연구, 프로토콜 개발, 보조금 및 모든 기타 비용에 활용되는 이더리움 재단의 연간 예산은 3000만 달러에 불과하다. 이더리움 재단을 제외한 다른 자금 지원도 있지만, 이는 단지 몇배 정도 더 높을 뿐이다. 비트코인의 연구개발(R&amp;D) 예산 지출은 이보다 훨씬 낮다. 비트코인 생태계의 연구개발은 기업들이 주로 자금을 조달하고 있다. (<a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/bitcoin-companies-seed-funding\">이 페이지</a>에 따르면 현재까지 총 2억 5천만 달러가 모금되었다) 또한, <a href=\"https://blog.bitmex.com/who-funds-bitcoin-development/\">이 보고서</a>에 따르면 약 57명의 직원들이 고용되어 있는데, 이들이 꽤 높은 급여를 받는다고 가정할 때 총 비용은 약 연간 2000만 달러로 추산된다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/605/0*ZVCxkTfWAB6eDGj6.png\"></figure><p>분명히, 이러한 비용 구조는 생태계의 자원이 매우 부적절하게 분배 되었다는 사실을 보여 준다. 만약 네트워크 해시파워의 20%를 마이닝이 아닌 연구 및 핵심 프로토콜 개발에 투입 했다면, 이는 생태계에 훨씬 더 높은 가치를 제공할 수 있었을 것이다. 그렇다면 PoW 예산을 20% 절감하는 대신 이 자금을 다른 일을 하는데에 투입하면 어떨까?</p>\\n<p>이러한 문제들은 일반적으로 “공공선택론(public choice theory)”과 “셸링 펜스(Schelling fences)”와 같은 개념들로 설명될 수 있다. 이에 따르면, 일부 자금을 더 가치 있는 공공재에 일시적으로 투자하는 것은 비교적 쉽지만, 이를 규칙적이고 제도화된 형태로 만드는것은 장기적으로 많은 정치적 혼란을 야기하기 때문에 쉽지 않다. 하지만 이와 별개로, <strong>비트코인과 이더리움 생태계와 같은 유기체가 수십억 달러의 자본을 일으킬 수 있지만, 이 자본의 흐름이 다소 이상하고 난해한 제약하에 있다는 것</strong>은 매우 흥미로운 사실이다.</p>\\n<p>우리는 이러한 상황을 만드는 강력한 사회적 힘에 대해 이해할 필요가 있다. 앞으로 자세히 살펴 보겠지만, 이는 이더리움 생태계가 최초에 이러한 자원들을 이끌어 낼 수 있었던 사회적 힘과 동일하다. (기술적으로 거의 동일한 이더리움 클래식은 그러지 못했다.) 블록체인이 51% 공격으로부터 안전할 수 있는 이유 또한 이러한 사회적 힘을 바탕으로 한다. 이러한 사회적 힘은 비단 블록체인 영역 뿐만 아니라 다른 모든 강력한 사회적 메커니즘의 기초가 된다. 그 이유에 대해서는 다음 장에서 자세히 설명 하겠지만, 우선 이 강력한 사회적 힘을 ‘정당성(legitimacy)’이라고 부르겠다.</p>\\n<blockquote>역주) 이더리움과 이더리움 클래식은 기술적으로 완전히 동일한 구조에서 출발했지만, 2021년 4월 현재 이더리움의 시가총액은 약 2500억 달러에 이르고, 이더리움 클래식은 약 38억 달러에 불과하다. 이러한 차이가 어디에서 비롯 되었는지 생각해 볼 필요가 있다.</blockquote>\\n<h3>코인은 사회적 계약에 의해 소유될 수 있다</h3>\\n<p>정당성을 잘 이해할 수 있는 중요한 예시 중 하나는 바로 스팀(Steem)과 하이브(Hive)의 이야기이다. 2020년 초, 저스틴 선(Justin Sun)은 기업-스팀을 인수하여 전체 STEEM 토큰 공급량의 20%를 보유하게 되었지만, 정확히 블록체인-스팀을 인수한 것은 아니었다. 스팀 커뮤니티는 당연하게도 저스틴을 신뢰하지 않았다. 따라서, 커뮤니티는 다음과 같은 내용을 포함한 신사협정을 공식적으로 적용하기 위해 온체인 투표를 실시하였다.</p>\\n<p><em>기업 스팀이 보유하고 있는 스팀 코인은 스팀 블록체인의 공익을 위해서만 사용 되어야 하고 어떠한 투표에도 사용될 수 없다.</em></p>\\n<p>하지만, 저스틴 선은 거래소에 보관된 코인을 이용해 체인을 일방적으로 통제할 수 있는 충분한 대표자 수를 확보하여 반격에 나섰다. 커뮤니티는 더 이상 프로토콜 내에서 이 문제를 해결할 수 있는 방법이 없었다. 그래서 이들은 스팀 블록체인을 완전히 동일하게 포크한 하이브(Hive)라고 하는 새로운 블록체인을 만들었다. 물론 하이브는 커뮤니티를 공격했던 저스틴 선의 잔액을 제외하고는 기존 스팀과 모두 동일하게 만들어졌다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/823/0*mHX-ZfID12EW9XcJ.png\"><figcaption>포크 이후 하이브에는 수 많은 어플리케이션이 만들어졌다. 만약 커뮤니티가 하이브를 만들지 않았다면, 많은 사용자들은 스팀에 그대로 남거나 또는 다른 프로젝트로 옮겨 갔을 것이다.</figcaption></figure><p>이를 통해 우리가 얻을 수 있는 교훈은 스팀이라는 기업은 실질적으로 스팀을 소유하지 않았다는 것이다. 만약 그랬다면 이들은 이 코인을 이용해 원하는 것이 무엇이든 기꺼이 취할 수 있었을 것이다. 하지만 현실은 결과적으로 기업이 커뮤니티에 반하는 형태로 코인을 마음대로 이용하여 이익을 취할 수 없게 되었다. 스팀과 하이브에서 일어난 일들은 아직 발행되지 않은 비트코인과 이더리움의 코인 보상에서 나타나는 일들과 매우 비슷한 형태를 띈다. 결국 코인은 궁극적으로 암호키가 아닌 일종의 사회적 계약이 소유한다는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>우리는 이러한 접근방식을 다른 블록체인 영역에도 적용할 수 있다. 예를 들어, ENS 루트 멀티시그(ENS root multisig) 계정을 생각해보자. 이 루트 멀티시그는 7명의 저명한 ENS 와 이더리움 커뮤니티 멤버에 의해 관리되는데, 만약에 이 7명 중 4명이 모여 도메인 관리자를 업그레이드하여 가장 높은 가치를 갖는 도메인의 소유권을 자신들에게 이전한다고 하면 어떻게 될까? ENS 스마트 컨트랙트 시스템의 맥락에서 이들은 충분히 이렇게 할 수 있는 능력이 있고, 어떤 이들도 이를 막을 수는 없다. 하지만 이들이 실제로 이러한 방식으로 능력을 남용하려 했을 때, 어떤 일이 일어날지는 쉽게 예측 가능하다. 이 관리자들은 커뮤니티에서 완전히 배제될 것이고, 나머지 ENS 커뮤니티 구성원들은 새로운 ENS 컨트랙트를 만들어 기존의 도메인 소유자들에게 소유권을 다시 돌려줄 것이다. 또한 기존의 ENS를 사용하고 있던 모든 이더리움 어플리케이션은 UI를 수정하여 새로운 ENS 컨트랙트를 사용할 것이다.</p>\\n<p>이런 논의는 사실 스마트 컨트랙트의 영역을 벗어난다. 일론 머스크는 자신의 트윗을 NFT로 만들어 쉽게 판매할 수 있지만, 제프 베조스는 왜 일론의 트윗을 판매하기 힘들까? 일론과 제프 모두 일론의 트윗을 스크린샷으로 찍어 이를 NFT로 만들 수 있다. 도대체 무엇이 다른가? 사회 심리학(또는 위조 미술품)에 대한 아주 기초적인 지식이 있다면 누구나 이렇게 답할 것이다. 일론이 일론의 트윗을 파는것은 진품이지만, 제프가 파는것은 가품이다. <strong>다시 강조하지만, 수백만 달러에 달하는 가치를 움직이고 분배하는 주체는 어떤 개인이나 암호키가 아니라 정당성이라는 사회적 관념이다.</strong></p>\\n<p>더 나아가, 정당성은 모든 종류의 사회적 지위 게임, 지적 담론, 언어, 재산권, 정치 시스템, 국경선 등에 강력하게 영향을 미친다. 심지어 블록체인 컨센서스도 비슷한 방식으로 동작한다. 커뮤니티는 51% 검열 공격이 발생하면 공격자를 제거하기 위해 리커버리(Recovery) 포크를 진행한다. 반대로 일반적인 소프트포크는 어떠한 이견 없이 받아들인다. 이 둘간의 유일한 차이점은 바로 정당성이다.</p>\\n<h3>정당성이란 도대체 무엇인가?</h3>\\n<p><a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/12/17/voting.html\"><em>블록체인 거버넌스에 대한 지난 글</em></a><em>도 함께 참고하라.</em></p>\\n<p>정당성이 어떻게 구성되는지 이해하려면 게임이론에 대해 살펴봐야 한다. 세상에는 <strong>조정 행위(coordinated behavior)</strong>를 필요로 하는 수 많은 상황들이 있다. 조정 행위란 한 사람이 홀로 행동하면 아무것도 얻지 못하지만, 다른 사람들과 다 같이 함께 행동한다면 원하는 결과를 얻을 수 있는 것을 말한다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/222/0*WRej_1WoO6xKKp7o.png\"><figcaption>단순한 조정게임(coordination game)의 예시이다. 모든 참가자가 동일한 선택을 해야만 이익을 극대화할 수 있다.</figcaption></figure><p>조정게임의 일반적인 예시중 하나는 운전을 할 때 중앙선의 좌측 차선을 달릴지 또는 우측 차선을 달릴지에 대한 것이다. 이 때 각 사람들이 구체적으로 어떤 차선을 선택할지는 크게 중요하지 않다. 중요한 것은 이들이 모두 같은 방향으로 달려야 한다는 것이다. 만약 여러분이 모든 사람들이 함께 방향을 동시에 바꾸고, 그리고 대부분의 사람들이 이에 대해 불만이 없다면 아무런 문제가 없을 것이다. 하지만 아무리 여러분이 다른 방향에서 운전하는것을 좋아한다고 해도, 나 홀로 방향을 바꾼다면 엄청난 손해를 보게 될 것이다.</p>\\n<p>이제 우리는 정당성을 정의할 준비가 되었다.</p>\\n<blockquote>정당성은 고차원적 수용(higher-order acceptance)의 한 패턴이다. 어떠한 사회적 맥락에서 만약 사람들이 어떠한 결과에 대해 폭넓게 동의하고, 이 결과를 얻기 위해 모두가 각자의 역할을 수행하고, 모든 다른 이들도 동일하게 그러할 것이라 기대한다면 이 결과는 정당하다 할 수 있다.</blockquote>\\n<p>정당성은 조정게임(coordination game)에서 자연스럽게 발생하는 현상이다. 만약 조정게임이 아니라면 다른 사람이 어떻게 행동할지 면밀히 파악하고 이에 따라 스스로의 행동을 조정할 필요가 없기에, 정당성을 고려할 필요가 없다. 하지만 앞서 확인한 바와 같이, 조정게임은 우리 사회 어디에나 존재하기에 정당성은 실제로 매우 중요하다. 조정게임이 충분히 오랫동안 진행되는 거의 모든 환경에서, 어떠한 선택을 할지에 대한 의사결정 메커니즘은 반드시 등장한다. 모든 사람은 이 메커니즘에 대해 의식하게 되고, (대체로) 메커니즘에 따라 행동하게 된다. 각 구성원은 다른 모든 이들이 이 메커니즘을 따라 의사결정을 할 것이기 때문에, 만약 자신이 다른 선택을 한다면 이는 갈등과 혼란을 불러 일으키거나, 또는 다른 모든 이들이 떠난 생태계에서 홀로 남게 될 것이라 생각하게 된다. 따라서 어떠한 메커니즘이 각 구성원의 의사결정에 성공적으로 영향을 미친다면, 그 메커니즘은 정당성을 가진다고 할 수 있다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/736/0*CaAWy-nyGn4DUzev.jpg\"><figcaption>비잔틴 장군이 자신의 군대를 이끌고 있다. 이는 단순히 병사들에게 용기를 주고 사기를 높이기 위함이 아니라, 다른 모든 병사들 또한 용감하게 앞으로 돌격할 것이며, 각 병사들은 그저 자살 행위와도 같은 나 홀로 돌격을 하지 않을 것이라는 확신을 주기 위함이다.</figcaption></figure><p>어떤 맥락에서든, 충분히 오랫동안 조정게임이 이어진다면 정당성에 대한 개념이 확립될 가능성이 크다. 또한, 블록체인은 수 많은 조정게임들로 구성된다. 여러분은 어떤 클라이언트를 사용하고 있는가? .eth 와 관련된 주소를 관리하는 탈중앙 도메인 네임 레지스트리는 무엇인가? 수 많은 유니스왑(Uniswap) 컨트랙트의 복사본 중 어떤 컨트랙트를 진짜 유니스왑 거래소라고 생각하는가? 심지어 NFT 또한 일종의 조정게임이다. NFT의 가치를 구성하는 가장 중요한 두가지 요소는 첫째, NFT를 소유하고 있다는 자부심과 이를 다른 사람에게 과시할 수 있는 능력이고, 둘째, 이를 미래에 다시 팔 수 있을 것이라는 가능성이다. 이 두가지 요소 모두를 만족하기 위해 매우 중요한것이 바로 여러분이 구매한 NFT를 다른 모든 이들이 정당하다고(진품이라고) 여겨야 한다는 것이다. 이러한 모든 경우에서, 다른 모든 이들과 의견을 일치시키는 것은 큰 이익으로 이어지고, 이러한 상황을 이끄는 메커니즘은 매우 큰 힘을 갖는다.</p>\\n<h3>정당성 이론</h3>\\n<p>정당성이 형성되는 방법은 매우 다양하다. 일반적으로 어떠한 것이 정당성을 가질 때, 이것이 대부분의 사람들에게 심리적인 호소력이 있기 때문에 발생한다. 물론 사람들의 심리적 직관은 상당히 복잡하게 구성된다. 정당성에 대한 이론을 모두 나열하는 것은 불가능하지만, 우선 정당성을 형성하는 몇가지 방법들에 대해 살펴보자.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>물리력에 의한 정당성</strong>: 누군가 힘을 과시하며 그 누구도 자신의 뜻을 거스를 수 없으며 모두 자신을 따라야 할 것이라고 엄포를 놓았다고 하자. 대부분의 이들은 다른 사람들 또한 이 사람에게 대항하지 않을 것이라 생각하기 때문에 힘을 과시한 이의 뜻을 따르게 될 것이다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>지속성에 의한 정당성</strong>: 만약 어떠한 것이 T라는 시점에 정당했다면, 이는 T+1 에서도 기본적으로 정당할 것이다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>공정성에 의한 정당성</strong>: 만약 어떤것이 공정하다는 직관적인 개념을 만족한다면 이는 정당하다고 할 수 있다. 자세한 내용은 <a href=\"https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/\">확실한 중립성에 대한 이전 글</a>을 참고하라. 물론, 확실한 중립성이 공정성의 유일한 개념은 아니다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>과정에 의한 정당성</strong>: 만약 어떤 과정이 정당하다면, 이 과정으로 인한 결과 또한 정당성을 얻는다. (예: 민주주의에 의해 제정된 법은 이러한 방식으로 정당성을 얻기도 한다.)</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>능력에 의한 정당성</strong>: 어떤 과정의 결과물이 많은 사람들을 만족 시킨다면, 이 과정은 정당성을 얻기도 한다. (예: 성공적인 독재는 이러한 방식으로 정당성을 얻기도 한다.)</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>참여에 의한 정당성</strong>: 만약 사람들이 어떠한 결과를 선택하는데 참여한다면, 이는 모두가 정당하다고 여길 가능성이 높다. 이는 공정성과 완전히 동일하지는 않지만 비슷한 측면이 있다. 이는 사람들이 심리적으로 자신의 과거의 행동과 일관되게 행동하려는 심리적 기제에 의존한다.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>정당성은 서술적 개념이라는 것에 주목해야 한다. 만약 개인적인 의견으로 어떤 것이 끔찍하다고 생각하더라도 여전히 그것은 정당할 수 있다. 반대로 충분히 많은 사람들이 어떠한 결과에 대해 끔찍하다고 생각한다면, 이에 대한 정당성은 점차 사라지게 될 것이고 끝내 완전히 없어지게 될 가능성이 매우 높다.</p>\\n<h3>정당성은 강력한 사회적 기술이며, 우리는 이를 적극 활용해야 한다</h3>\\n<p>안타깝게도 암호화폐 생태계에서 공공재에 대한 투자는 매우 부족한 것이 현실이다. 수천 조 단위의 자본이 이곳 저곳으로 흐르고 있지만, 정작 이 자본이 계속 유지되고 성장하기 위해 필요한 공공재에 대한 투자 금액은 매년 수천억원 정도에 불과하다.</p>\\n<p>이를 해결하기 위한 방법에는 크게 두가지가 있다. 첫번째는 비록 아주 효과적인 방법은 아니지만, 이러한 한계들을 극복하기 위해 커뮤니티가 열심히 노력하는 것에 자부심을 갖는 것이다. 주로 비트코인 커뮤니티가 취하고 있는 방법이다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JGLWo1UNg5ZR_8td8EZBMw.png\"></figure><p>자기 자신을 희생하며 코어 개발에 힘쓰고 있는 여러 팀들의 노력은 물론 칭찬 받아 마땅하다. 하지만 이와 비슷한 방식으로 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/50025543\">엘리우드 킵초게가 마라톤을 2시간 이내에 완주한 것</a> 또한 칭찬 받아 마땅하다. 엘리우드가 초인적인 능력을 보여주었다는 점은 매우 인상적이지만, 이와 별개로 엘리우드가 교통(암호화폐 생태계에서는 공공재에 대한 투자)의 미래가 될 수는 없다. 고도로 발전된 기술이 초인적인 능력과 수년간에 걸친 고된 훈련이 없어도 모든 사람들이 한 시간 이내에 42km를 이동할 수 있게 한 것처럼, <strong>필요한 규모의 공공재에 대한 투자를 이끌어내기 위해 우리는 더 발전된 사회적 기술을 구축하는데 힘써야 한다. 또한, 이는 단발성의 박애적 자선행위로 그쳐서는 안되고, 이 기술이 경제 시스템의 일부분으로 동작하게 해야 한다.</strong></p>\\n<p>이제 다시 암호화폐 이야기로 돌아가보자. 암호화폐(또는 도메인 네임, 가상 토지, NFT 등의 디지털 자산)의 가장 큰 힘은 어떤 한 개인이 막대한 자본을 기부하지 않아도 커뮤니티에서 이러한 자본을 이끌어 낼 수 있다는 것이다. 하지만 이렇게 형성된 자본은 정당성의 개념에 의해 제한된다. 예를 들어, 어떤 중앙화된 팀에 자본을 분배한다고 할 때, 이에 대한 커뮤니티의 합의가 충분히 이루어지지 않는다면 이러한 의사결정은 진행될 수 없을 것이다. 비트코인과 이더리움은 <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/responding-to-51-attacks-in-casper-ffg/6363\">51% 공격을 방지하기 위해</a> 정당성의 개념에 이미 의존하고 있지만, 정당성을 통해 공공재에 대한 투자를 프로토콜 내부에서 이끌어내는 것은 더욱 어려운 일이다. 하지만, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/growing-list-of-billion-dollar-crypto-unicorns-suggest-the-best-is-yet-to-come\">점차</a> 어플리케이션 레이어가 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million\">성장</a>하고 있고 이에 대한 새로운 프로토콜이 계속해서 개발되고 있다는 점에서, 우리는 공공재에 대한 투자를 보다 더 유연하게 이끌어 낼 수 있게 되었다.</p>\\n<h3>비트쉐어에서의 정당성</h3>\\n<p>오랫동안 잊혀져 있었던 아이디어 중 하나지만, 개인적으로 초기 암호화폐 업계에서 가장 혁신적이었던 아이디어는 <a href=\"https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?PHPSESSID=h7u4curkvqm5dn9gs9q3end8j0&amp;topic=5.0\">비트쉐어</a>의 <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20140209035756/https://invictus-innovations.com/social-consensus/\">사회 합의</a> 모델이라고 생각한다. 본질적으로, 비트쉐어는 생태계 내부의 새로운 프로젝트들을 집단적으로 지원하려는 사람들의(<a href=\"https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=1964.0\">PTS와 AGS 보유자</a>) 커뮤니티이다. 하지만, 어떠한 프로젝트가 이 생태계에서 환영받기 위해서는 해당 프로젝트 토큰 공급량의 10%를 PTS와 AGS 보유자에게 할당해야 한다.</p>\\n<p>물론, 누구나 PTS와 AGS 보유자에게 토큰을 할당하지 않고 프로젝트를 진행할 수 있고, 토큰을 할당한 프로젝트를 포크하여 토큰을 할당하지 않은 버전만 사용할 수도 있다. 하지만 이에 대해 댄 라리머는 아래와 같이 주장했다.</p>\\n<blockquote>다른 모든 이에게 강요할 순 없지만, 그래도 이 시장에서 가장 중요한건 바로 네트워크 효과다. 예를 들어, 엄청난 아이디어를 구현한다고 할 때, 이를 위한 새로운 블록체인을 만드는데 비용을 투자하지 않고, 해당 비용을 커뮤니티에 기여하는데 사용한다면 전체 PTS 커뮤니티의 지원을 받을 수 있을 것이다. 반대로 만약 이를 완전히 처음부터 개발한다면, 결국 새로운 커뮤니티를 구축하기 위해 많은 노력을 들여야 할 것이다. 나는 이러한 네트워크 효과로 인해 PTS 보유자에 혜택을 주는 프로젝트가 그렇지 않은 프로젝트에 비해 더 성공할 것이라 본다.</blockquote>\\n<p>댄 라리머의 주장 또한 정당성의 개념과 관련이 있다. PTS/AGS 보유자에게 토큰을 할당하는 모든 프로젝트는 커뮤니티의 지지와 관심을 받을 것이다. 또한, 다른 모든 커뮤니티 구성원들이 동일하게 관심을 가질 것이기 때문에, 각 커뮤니티 구성원 개인의 입장에서 관심을 가질 만한 가치가 있을 것이다. 반대로 토큰을 커뮤니티에 할당하지 않는 프로젝트들은 이러한 관심과 지원을 얻지 못할 것이다. <strong>물론, 우리가 원하는 정당성은 정확히 이러한 개념은 아니다. 이더리움 커뮤니티에는 비트쉐어와 같이 소규모 얼리 어답터들이 새로운 프로젝트에 관심을 갖게 할 만한 장치가 거의 없다. 하지만, 우리는 이러한 방식을 이더리움 커뮤니티에 훨씬 더 유용한 형태로 변형할 수 있다.</strong></p>\\n<h3>이더리움에 적용하기</h3>\\n<p>이더리움을 포함한 모든 블록체인 생태계는 자유와 탈중앙성을 중요한 가치로 둔다. 하지만 대부분의 블록체인에서 공공재 생태계는 아쉽게도 여전히 상당히 권위주의적이고, 중앙화 되어 있다. 이더리움, 지캐시(Zcash) 또는 다른 주요 블록체인에서, 대체로 하나(또는 최대 2~3개)의 팀이 다른 모든 이들을 합한것보다 훨씬 더 많은 비용을 지출하고 있으며, 공공재를 구축하고자 하는 다른 독립적인 팀들에게는 별 다른 선택지가 없는 상황이다. 나는 이러한 공공재에 대한 투자 모델을 “공공재 중앙 자본 조정자”(Central Capital Coordinators for Public-goods, CCCPs)라고 부르겠다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/395/0*RXmfyFU17bdsZogO.png\"></figure><p><strong>현재의 이런 상황이 생태계를 위해 최선을 다하고 있는 조직, 단체 또는 기관의 잘못은 아니다. 오히려 이러한 조직들은 생태계의 규약으로 인해 부당한 대우를 받았는데, 대체로 사람들은 이러한 조직에 지나치게 높은 평가 기준을 갖고 있기 때문이다.</strong> 모든 중앙화된 조직들은 필연적으로 사각지대가 존재할 수 밖에 없으며, 실제로는 중요하지만 이를 제대로 수행하지 못하는 여러 영역이나 팀들이 있을 수 밖에 없다. 이는 이와 관련된 사람들의 능력이 부족했기 때문이 아니라, 이러한 완벽함은 소규모 조직의 능력 밖의 영역이기 때문이다. 따라서, 공공재에 대한 투자를 위해 보다 다양하고 탄력적인 접근 방식을 취하여 이러한 소규모 단일 조직에 대한 부담을 덜어줄 필요가 있다.</p>\\n<p>다행히, 우리는 이미 그러한 방법의 단초를 갖고 있다. 이더리움의 어플리케이션 레이어는 계속해서 발전하고 있으며, 이미 공공의 정신(public-spiritedness)을 보여주고 있다. 노시스(Gnosis)와 같은 기업들은 이더리움 클라이언트 개발에 기여하고 있으며, 다양한 디파이(DeFi) 프로젝트들은 깃코인(Gitcoin) 매칭 풀에 수십만 달러를 기부하였다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*uLIxfMSbB_jWesJP.png\"></figure><p>깃코인 그랜츠(Gitcoin Grants)는 이미 높은 수준의 정당성을 확보하였다. 깃코인의 공공재 펀딩 메커니즘인 <a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html\">쿼드라틱 펀딩(quadratic funding)</a>은 <a href=\"https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/\">확실한 중립성(credibly neutral)</a>을 보여주었고, 커뮤니티의 우선순위와 가치들을 효과적으로 반영하며 기존의 펀딩 메커니즘으로 메울 수 없었던 빈틈을 잘 보완할 수 있다는 것을 보여주었다. 또한, 상위 깃코인 그랜츠 매칭 수여자들은 다른 중앙화된 그랜츠 수여 단체들에게 좋은 영감이 되기도 한다. 이더리움 재단 또한 몰록다오(MolochDAO) 등과 함께 깃코인 그랜츠와 같은 프로젝트를 육성하여 이러한 실험과 다양성을 지원하는데 핵심적인 역할을 해왔으며, 계속해서 더 많은 커뮤니티의 지원을 받고 있다.</p>\\n<p>우리는 비트쉐어 모델을 수정 및 도입하여 초기 공공재 투자 생태계를 더 탄탄하게 구축할 수 있다. 2013년에 PTS와 AGS를 구매한 소규모 집단에 토큰을 할당한 프로젝트에 강력한 커뮤니티 지원을 제공하는 대신에, <strong>자금의 일부를 해당 프로젝트가 속한 생태계의 공공재 부문에 투자하는 프로젝트를 강력하게 지원할 수 있다.</strong> 또한, 가장 중요한 것은, 기존 프로젝트를 포크했지만 그 가치를 생태계를 위해 투자하지 않는 프로젝트에는 이러한 혜택을 제공하지 않을 수 있다는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>공공재를 지원하기 위한 방법에는 여러가지가 있다. 깃코인 그랜츠 매칭 풀에 대한 장기적인 지원, 이더리움 클라이언트 개발 지원(이더리움 클라이언트가 무엇인지에 대한 명확한 정의가 있기 때문에 확실한 중립성을 갖는 작업이라 할 수 있다.) 또는 특정 어플리케이션 프로젝트 영역을 벗어난 범위에서 또 다른 독자적인 그랜츠 프로그램을 운영하는 방법들이 있을 수 있다. 특정 프로젝트가 생태계에 충분한 지원과 기여를 했는지 판단하는 가장 쉬운 방법 은 투자 금액을 기준으로 삼는 것이다. 예를 들어, 프로젝트 예산의 5%는 생태계에 기여하기 위해서 사용되고, 1%는 블록체인 외부의 공공재를 위해 사용되며, 해당 투자금이 필요한 영역에 사용될 것이라는 믿음이 있다면, 우리는 이에 대해 보다 쉽게 판단할 수 있을 것이다.</p>\\n<h3>커뮤니티는 실제로 많은 영향력이 있는가?</h3>\\n<p>물론 이런 방식의 커뮤니티 지원에는 분명히 한계가 존재한다. 경쟁 프로젝트(또는 기존 프로젝트의 포크 버전)가 사용자에게 더 나은 서비스를 제공한다면, 다른 많은 사람들이 생태계에 더 많이 기여하는 프로젝트를 사용해야 한다고 주장하더라도, 사용자들은 서비스가 더 나은 프로젝트를 사용할 것이다.</p>\\n<p>하지만 우리는 이러한 한계를 다른 맥락에서 해결할 수 있다. 때로는 커뮤니티의 영향력이 약하기도 하지만, 때로는 상당히 강할때도 있다. 이와 관련한 흥미로운 사례중 하나는 <a href=\"https://tether.to/\">테더(Tether)</a> vs <a href=\"https://makerdao.com/\">다이(DAI)</a> 이다. 트레이더들은 테더에 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4403640-tethers-credibility-and-impact-on-bitcoin\">많은 논란</a>이 있음에도 불구하고 달러를 보유하고 송금하기 위해 테더를 사용한다. 다이가 테더에 비해 상대적으로 더 탈중앙화 되어 있고 투명하게 작동한다는 장점에도 불구하고, 트레이더들은 다이가 아닌 테더를 사용하므로 다이가 테더보다 높은 시장점유율을 확보하는것은 현실적으로 어렵다. 하지만 다이는 어플리케이션 영역에서 빛을 발하고 있다. <a href=\"https://augur2.eth.link/#!/markets\">어거</a>도 다이를 사용하고, <a href=\"https://www.xdaichain.com/\">엑스다이(xDai)</a>도 다이를 사용하며, <a href=\"https://app.pooltogether.com/\">풀투게더(PoolTogether)</a> 또한 다이를 사용한다. 또한 <a href=\"http://zk.money/\">zk.money</a>도 DAI를 사용할 예정이다. 이외에도 <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/awesome-makerdao#dai-1\">수 많은 프로젝트들이 DAI를 사용</a>하고 있거나 사용할 예정이다. 테더(USDT)를 사용하는 댑(Dapp)은 얼마나 있는가? 매우 적을 것이다.</p>\\n<p>정리하면, 커뮤니티 기반의 정당성이 갖는 힘이 무한한것은 아니지만, 그럼에도 불구하고 상당한 활용 여지는 있다. 이는 각 프로젝트들이 예산의 일부를 생태계를 위해 사용하도록 장려하기에 충분하다. 또한, 각 프로젝트들이 이러한 균형에 응하는(정당성을 따르는) 이기적인 이유도 존재한다. 만약 여러분이 이더리움 지갑의 개발자이거나, 팟캐스트나 뉴스레터의 저자라고 해보자. 두개의 경쟁 프로젝트가 있을 때, 하나는 여러분을 포함한 생태계를 위한 공공재에 크게 기여하고 있고, 다른 하나는 그렇지 않다고 하자. 이 때 여러분은 어떤 프로젝트가 더 높은 시장 점유율을 확보할 수 있도록 도와 주겠는가?</p>\\n<h3>NFTs: 이더리움 너머의 공공재를 지원하다</h3>\\n<p>정당성의 개념을 근거로 한 이더로부터 창출된 가치를 공공재에 기여하는 행위는 이더리움 생태계에 국한되지 않으며, 더 큰 가치를 갖는다. 현재 우리가 당면해 있는 가장 중요한 도전과 기회는 바로 NFT이다. NFT는 여러 공공재 부문과 특히 창조적 다양성 부분에서 크게 도움이 될 것으로 보이며, 이들의 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons\">만성적이고 구조적인 자금 부족 문제</a>를 최소한 부분적으로 해결할 수 있을 가능성이 높다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/770/0*q8djcTWUnoMVTrnV.png\"><figcaption>아주 훌륭한 첫 걸음.</figcaption></figure><p>하지만 우리는 이 기회를 놓치게 될 수도 있다. 일론 머스크가 자신의 트윗을 판매해서 백만 달러를 벌어 자기 자신을 위해 사용한다면, 사회적 측면에서 이는 가치가 거의 없다고 할 수 있다. 물론, 일론은 결국 <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/elon-musk-turns-down-1-million-offer-to-buy-his-tweet-as-an-nft.html\">NFT를 팔지 않기</a>로 했고, 이는 분명히 칭찬 받아 마땅하다. 만약 NFT가 이미 부유한 셀럽들에게 더 큰 부를 가져다 주는 카지노가 된다면, 이는 그렇게 썩 흥미로운 결과는 아닐 것이다.</p>\\n<p><strong>다행히도, 우리는 이러한 결과를 바꿀 수 있는 힘이 있다.</strong> 특정 NFT는 많은 사람들이 구매 하고 싶어하고, 다른 NFT는 그렇지 않을 때, 이 둘 사이를 구분짓는 것은 결국 정당성에 대한 것이다. 만약 모든 사람이 어떤 NFT는 흥미롭고 다른 것은 그렇지 않다고 생각한다면, 사람들은 모두 전자를 구매하려고 할 것이다. 전자를 구매 했을 때, 해당 NFT를 보유하고 있다는 자부심과 함께 이를 뽐낼 수 있는 권한을 가지며, 다른 모든 이들도 이와 동일하게 생각할 것이므로 이들에게 NFT를 되 팔기도 쉬울 것이기 때문이다. NFT에 대한 정당성의 개념이 바람직한 방향으로 형성된다면, NFT는 예술가, 자선 단체 등에게 탄탄한 자금원을 구축할 수 있는 기회가 될 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>이와 관련하여 생각해 볼 수 있는 두가지 아이디어가 있다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>일부 기관(심지어 DAO도)은 수익의 일부분이 자선적인 목적으로 사용 되어 다양한 집단에게 이익이 될 것임을 보장한다면, 이러한 NFT를 “축성(bless)”할 수도 있다. 이러한 축성은 다음과 같이 이에 대한 공식적인 분류를 만들어 낼 수도 있다. 해당 NFT는 세계 빈곤 구제, 과학 연구, 창조 예술, 지역 저널리즘, 오픈소스 소프트웨어 개발, 소외된 지역사회에 대한 지원 또는 다른 가치 있는 것들에 기여하고 있는가?</li>\\n<li>소셜 미디어 플랫폼과 협력하여 NFT가 사람들의 개인 프로필에 잘 드러날 수 있게 하여, NFT의 구매자들이 중요하게 생각하는 가치를 단지 말이 아니라 힘들게 얻어낸 돈을 통해 보여줄 수 있는 방법을 제공할 수 있다. 이는 (1)과 결합되어 사용자들로 하여금 사회적 가치에 더 기여하도록 넛지(nudge)할 수 있다.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>이외에도 다른 아이디어들이 있지만, 분명한 것은 이 분야에 더 많은 조정 및 연구가 이뤄질 만한 가치가 있다는 것이다.</p>\\n<h3>정리</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>정당성(고차원적 수용)의 개념은 매우 강력하다. 정당성은 <a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/09/11/coordination.html\">조정</a>이 있는 모든 곳에서 나타나고, 특히 인터넷에서 조정은 어디에나 있다.</li>\\n<li>정당성이 형성될 수 있는 방식은 여러가지가 있다. 그 중 중요한 것들은 <strong>물리력, 지속성, 공정성, 과정, 능력, 참여</strong>이다.</li>\\n<li>암호화폐는 우리가 집단 경제 의지에 의해 대규모 자본을 이끌어 낼 수 있게 한다는 측면에서 매우 강력한 힘을 갖고 있다. 또한, 이러한 자본은 초기에는 어떤 특정 개인에 의해 움직이지 않는다. <strong>이러한 자본을 움직이게 만드는 힘은 바로 정당성이다.</strong>\\n</li>\\n<li>공공재에 대한 투자를 위해 베이스 레이어(base layer)에서 토큰을 공급하는 것은 매우 위험하다. 이더리움은 매우 풍부한 <strong>어플리케이션 생태계</strong>를 갖고 있고, 우리는 이를 이용해 훨씬 더 유연하게 재원을 마련할 수 있다. 이는 기존 프로젝트에 영향을 줄 수 있을 뿐만 아니라, 미래의 새로운 프로젝트에도 영향을 미칠 수 있다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>커뮤니티의 공공재에 기여하는 어플리케이션 프로젝트는 더 많은 커뮤니티의 지원을 받을 것이다. </strong>그리고<strong> </strong>이는 매우 중요하다. 다이 예시가 이러한 기여가 얼마나 중요한지를 보여 준다.</li>\\n<li>이더리움 생태계는 메커니즘 디자인과 소셜 레이어의 혁신에 힘쓰고 있다. <strong>이더리움 생태계 내부의 공공재 펀딩 챌린지는 좋은 시작점이다!</strong>\\n</li>\\n<li>하지만 이는 단순히 이더리움에만 국한되는 이야기는 아니다. NFT는 정당성에 따라 움직이는 대규모 자본의 한 예시일 뿐이다. NFT 산업은 단순히 가상세계를 넘어 예술가, 자선 단체 및 공공재 공급자에게 큰 도움이 될 수 있다. <strong>하지만 이는 아직 결정되지 않은 미래다. 이는 앞으로의 활발한 조정과 지원에 달려 있다.</strong>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=590a55668218\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/onther-tech/%EB%B8%94%EB%A1%9D%EC%B2%B4%EC%9D%B8%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C-%EA%B0%80%EC%9E%A5-%EC%A4%91%EC%9A%94%ED%95%9C-%EA%B2%83%EC%9D%80-%EC%A0%95%EB%8B%B9%EC%84%B1-%ED%99%95%EB%B3%B4%EB%8B%A4-the-most-important-scarce-resource-is-legitimacy-590a55668218\">블록체인에서 가장 중요한 것은 정당성 확보다(The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy)</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/onther-tech\">Onther</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\\n',\n                content:\n                  '\\n<blockquote>이 글은 비탈릭 부테린(Vitalik Buterin)의 글 <a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html\">The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy</a>을 우리말로 옮겨 쓴 글이다.</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>비탈릭 부테린은 이 글을 통해 블록체인에서 가장 중요한 자원이 무엇인지, 또 이를 활용하여 우리는 어떠한 가치를 만들어 낼 수 있는지에 대해 깊이 논의한다. 기술적인 논의보다는 사회 경제적인 논의가 주를 이루기 때문에, 블록체인에 관심이 있는 독자라면 누구나 쉽게 이 글을 이해할 수 있을 것이다.</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>이 글에서는 ‘Legitimacy’를 정당성으로 번역 하였는데, 실제로 이 글에서 다루는 ‘Legitimacy’ 는 ‘정당성’ 이외에도 ‘진짜인 것, 진품’ 등의 다양한 의미를 갖는다. 따라서, 이를 문자 그대로 받아들이기 보다, 행간을 통해 그 의미를 파악하는것을 권장한다.</blockquote>\\n<h3>들어가며</h3>\\n<p><em>Special thanks to Karl Floersch, Aya Miyaguchi and Mr Silly for ideas, feedback and review.</em></p>\\n<p>비트코인과 이더리움 블록체인 생태계는 작업증명 마이닝의 목적인 네트워크 안전성(security)을 위해 다른 모든 분야에 투입되는 것보다 훨씬 더 많은 양의 자원을 쏟아붓고 있다. 비트코인은 연초부터 하루 평균 약 3800만 달러의 블록 보상과 <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_total_transaction_fees_per_day\">약 500만 달러의 거래 수수료</a>를 마이너들에게 지급하고있다. 이더리움은 하루 1950만 달러의 블록 보상과 1800만 달러의 트랜잭션 수수료를 지급하고 있으며 이는 비트코인 다음으로 많은 양이다. 반면에, 연구, 프로토콜 개발, 보조금 및 모든 기타 비용에 활용되는 이더리움 재단의 연간 예산은 3000만 달러에 불과하다. 이더리움 재단을 제외한 다른 자금 지원도 있지만, 이는 단지 몇배 정도 더 높을 뿐이다. 비트코인의 연구개발(R&amp;D) 예산 지출은 이보다 훨씬 낮다. 비트코인 생태계의 연구개발은 기업들이 주로 자금을 조달하고 있다. (<a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/bitcoin-companies-seed-funding\">이 페이지</a>에 따르면 현재까지 총 2억 5천만 달러가 모금되었다) 또한, <a href=\"https://blog.bitmex.com/who-funds-bitcoin-development/\">이 보고서</a>에 따르면 약 57명의 직원들이 고용되어 있는데, 이들이 꽤 높은 급여를 받는다고 가정할 때 총 비용은 약 연간 2000만 달러로 추산된다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/605/0*ZVCxkTfWAB6eDGj6.png\"></figure><p>분명히, 이러한 비용 구조는 생태계의 자원이 매우 부적절하게 분배 되었다는 사실을 보여 준다. 만약 네트워크 해시파워의 20%를 마이닝이 아닌 연구 및 핵심 프로토콜 개발에 투입 했다면, 이는 생태계에 훨씬 더 높은 가치를 제공할 수 있었을 것이다. 그렇다면 PoW 예산을 20% 절감하는 대신 이 자금을 다른 일을 하는데에 투입하면 어떨까?</p>\\n<p>이러한 문제들은 일반적으로 “공공선택론(public choice theory)”과 “셸링 펜스(Schelling fences)”와 같은 개념들로 설명될 수 있다. 이에 따르면, 일부 자금을 더 가치 있는 공공재에 일시적으로 투자하는 것은 비교적 쉽지만, 이를 규칙적이고 제도화된 형태로 만드는것은 장기적으로 많은 정치적 혼란을 야기하기 때문에 쉽지 않다. 하지만 이와 별개로, <strong>비트코인과 이더리움 생태계와 같은 유기체가 수십억 달러의 자본을 일으킬 수 있지만, 이 자본의 흐름이 다소 이상하고 난해한 제약하에 있다는 것</strong>은 매우 흥미로운 사실이다.</p>\\n<p>우리는 이러한 상황을 만드는 강력한 사회적 힘에 대해 이해할 필요가 있다. 앞으로 자세히 살펴 보겠지만, 이는 이더리움 생태계가 최초에 이러한 자원들을 이끌어 낼 수 있었던 사회적 힘과 동일하다. (기술적으로 거의 동일한 이더리움 클래식은 그러지 못했다.) 블록체인이 51% 공격으로부터 안전할 수 있는 이유 또한 이러한 사회적 힘을 바탕으로 한다. 이러한 사회적 힘은 비단 블록체인 영역 뿐만 아니라 다른 모든 강력한 사회적 메커니즘의 기초가 된다. 그 이유에 대해서는 다음 장에서 자세히 설명 하겠지만, 우선 이 강력한 사회적 힘을 ‘정당성(legitimacy)’이라고 부르겠다.</p>\\n<blockquote>역주) 이더리움과 이더리움 클래식은 기술적으로 완전히 동일한 구조에서 출발했지만, 2021년 4월 현재 이더리움의 시가총액은 약 2500억 달러에 이르고, 이더리움 클래식은 약 38억 달러에 불과하다. 이러한 차이가 어디에서 비롯 되었는지 생각해 볼 필요가 있다.</blockquote>\\n<h3>코인은 사회적 계약에 의해 소유될 수 있다</h3>\\n<p>정당성을 잘 이해할 수 있는 중요한 예시 중 하나는 바로 스팀(Steem)과 하이브(Hive)의 이야기이다. 2020년 초, 저스틴 선(Justin Sun)은 기업-스팀을 인수하여 전체 STEEM 토큰 공급량의 20%를 보유하게 되었지만, 정확히 블록체인-스팀을 인수한 것은 아니었다. 스팀 커뮤니티는 당연하게도 저스틴을 신뢰하지 않았다. 따라서, 커뮤니티는 다음과 같은 내용을 포함한 신사협정을 공식적으로 적용하기 위해 온체인 투표를 실시하였다.</p>\\n<p><em>기업 스팀이 보유하고 있는 스팀 코인은 스팀 블록체인의 공익을 위해서만 사용 되어야 하고 어떠한 투표에도 사용될 수 없다.</em></p>\\n<p>하지만, 저스틴 선은 거래소에 보관된 코인을 이용해 체인을 일방적으로 통제할 수 있는 충분한 대표자 수를 확보하여 반격에 나섰다. 커뮤니티는 더 이상 프로토콜 내에서 이 문제를 해결할 수 있는 방법이 없었다. 그래서 이들은 스팀 블록체인을 완전히 동일하게 포크한 하이브(Hive)라고 하는 새로운 블록체인을 만들었다. 물론 하이브는 커뮤니티를 공격했던 저스틴 선의 잔액을 제외하고는 기존 스팀과 모두 동일하게 만들어졌다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/823/0*mHX-ZfID12EW9XcJ.png\"><figcaption>포크 이후 하이브에는 수 많은 어플리케이션이 만들어졌다. 만약 커뮤니티가 하이브를 만들지 않았다면, 많은 사용자들은 스팀에 그대로 남거나 또는 다른 프로젝트로 옮겨 갔을 것이다.</figcaption></figure><p>이를 통해 우리가 얻을 수 있는 교훈은 스팀이라는 기업은 실질적으로 스팀을 소유하지 않았다는 것이다. 만약 그랬다면 이들은 이 코인을 이용해 원하는 것이 무엇이든 기꺼이 취할 수 있었을 것이다. 하지만 현실은 결과적으로 기업이 커뮤니티에 반하는 형태로 코인을 마음대로 이용하여 이익을 취할 수 없게 되었다. 스팀과 하이브에서 일어난 일들은 아직 발행되지 않은 비트코인과 이더리움의 코인 보상에서 나타나는 일들과 매우 비슷한 형태를 띈다. 결국 코인은 궁극적으로 암호키가 아닌 일종의 사회적 계약이 소유한다는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>우리는 이러한 접근방식을 다른 블록체인 영역에도 적용할 수 있다. 예를 들어, ENS 루트 멀티시그(ENS root multisig) 계정을 생각해보자. 이 루트 멀티시그는 7명의 저명한 ENS 와 이더리움 커뮤니티 멤버에 의해 관리되는데, 만약에 이 7명 중 4명이 모여 도메인 관리자를 업그레이드하여 가장 높은 가치를 갖는 도메인의 소유권을 자신들에게 이전한다고 하면 어떻게 될까? ENS 스마트 컨트랙트 시스템의 맥락에서 이들은 충분히 이렇게 할 수 있는 능력이 있고, 어떤 이들도 이를 막을 수는 없다. 하지만 이들이 실제로 이러한 방식으로 능력을 남용하려 했을 때, 어떤 일이 일어날지는 쉽게 예측 가능하다. 이 관리자들은 커뮤니티에서 완전히 배제될 것이고, 나머지 ENS 커뮤니티 구성원들은 새로운 ENS 컨트랙트를 만들어 기존의 도메인 소유자들에게 소유권을 다시 돌려줄 것이다. 또한 기존의 ENS를 사용하고 있던 모든 이더리움 어플리케이션은 UI를 수정하여 새로운 ENS 컨트랙트를 사용할 것이다.</p>\\n<p>이런 논의는 사실 스마트 컨트랙트의 영역을 벗어난다. 일론 머스크는 자신의 트윗을 NFT로 만들어 쉽게 판매할 수 있지만, 제프 베조스는 왜 일론의 트윗을 판매하기 힘들까? 일론과 제프 모두 일론의 트윗을 스크린샷으로 찍어 이를 NFT로 만들 수 있다. 도대체 무엇이 다른가? 사회 심리학(또는 위조 미술품)에 대한 아주 기초적인 지식이 있다면 누구나 이렇게 답할 것이다. 일론이 일론의 트윗을 파는것은 진품이지만, 제프가 파는것은 가품이다. <strong>다시 강조하지만, 수백만 달러에 달하는 가치를 움직이고 분배하는 주체는 어떤 개인이나 암호키가 아니라 정당성이라는 사회적 관념이다.</strong></p>\\n<p>더 나아가, 정당성은 모든 종류의 사회적 지위 게임, 지적 담론, 언어, 재산권, 정치 시스템, 국경선 등에 강력하게 영향을 미친다. 심지어 블록체인 컨센서스도 비슷한 방식으로 동작한다. 커뮤니티는 51% 검열 공격이 발생하면 공격자를 제거하기 위해 리커버리(Recovery) 포크를 진행한다. 반대로 일반적인 소프트포크는 어떠한 이견 없이 받아들인다. 이 둘간의 유일한 차이점은 바로 정당성이다.</p>\\n<h3>정당성이란 도대체 무엇인가?</h3>\\n<p><a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/12/17/voting.html\"><em>블록체인 거버넌스에 대한 지난 글</em></a><em>도 함께 참고하라.</em></p>\\n<p>정당성이 어떻게 구성되는지 이해하려면 게임이론에 대해 살펴봐야 한다. 세상에는 <strong>조정 행위(coordinated behavior)</strong>를 필요로 하는 수 많은 상황들이 있다. 조정 행위란 한 사람이 홀로 행동하면 아무것도 얻지 못하지만, 다른 사람들과 다 같이 함께 행동한다면 원하는 결과를 얻을 수 있는 것을 말한다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/222/0*WRej_1WoO6xKKp7o.png\"><figcaption>단순한 조정게임(coordination game)의 예시이다. 모든 참가자가 동일한 선택을 해야만 이익을 극대화할 수 있다.</figcaption></figure><p>조정게임의 일반적인 예시중 하나는 운전을 할 때 중앙선의 좌측 차선을 달릴지 또는 우측 차선을 달릴지에 대한 것이다. 이 때 각 사람들이 구체적으로 어떤 차선을 선택할지는 크게 중요하지 않다. 중요한 것은 이들이 모두 같은 방향으로 달려야 한다는 것이다. 만약 여러분이 모든 사람들이 함께 방향을 동시에 바꾸고, 그리고 대부분의 사람들이 이에 대해 불만이 없다면 아무런 문제가 없을 것이다. 하지만 아무리 여러분이 다른 방향에서 운전하는것을 좋아한다고 해도, 나 홀로 방향을 바꾼다면 엄청난 손해를 보게 될 것이다.</p>\\n<p>이제 우리는 정당성을 정의할 준비가 되었다.</p>\\n<blockquote>정당성은 고차원적 수용(higher-order acceptance)의 한 패턴이다. 어떠한 사회적 맥락에서 만약 사람들이 어떠한 결과에 대해 폭넓게 동의하고, 이 결과를 얻기 위해 모두가 각자의 역할을 수행하고, 모든 다른 이들도 동일하게 그러할 것이라 기대한다면 이 결과는 정당하다 할 수 있다.</blockquote>\\n<p>정당성은 조정게임(coordination game)에서 자연스럽게 발생하는 현상이다. 만약 조정게임이 아니라면 다른 사람이 어떻게 행동할지 면밀히 파악하고 이에 따라 스스로의 행동을 조정할 필요가 없기에, 정당성을 고려할 필요가 없다. 하지만 앞서 확인한 바와 같이, 조정게임은 우리 사회 어디에나 존재하기에 정당성은 실제로 매우 중요하다. 조정게임이 충분히 오랫동안 진행되는 거의 모든 환경에서, 어떠한 선택을 할지에 대한 의사결정 메커니즘은 반드시 등장한다. 모든 사람은 이 메커니즘에 대해 의식하게 되고, (대체로) 메커니즘에 따라 행동하게 된다. 각 구성원은 다른 모든 이들이 이 메커니즘을 따라 의사결정을 할 것이기 때문에, 만약 자신이 다른 선택을 한다면 이는 갈등과 혼란을 불러 일으키거나, 또는 다른 모든 이들이 떠난 생태계에서 홀로 남게 될 것이라 생각하게 된다. 따라서 어떠한 메커니즘이 각 구성원의 의사결정에 성공적으로 영향을 미친다면, 그 메커니즘은 정당성을 가진다고 할 수 있다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/736/0*CaAWy-nyGn4DUzev.jpg\"><figcaption>비잔틴 장군이 자신의 군대를 이끌고 있다. 이는 단순히 병사들에게 용기를 주고 사기를 높이기 위함이 아니라, 다른 모든 병사들 또한 용감하게 앞으로 돌격할 것이며, 각 병사들은 그저 자살 행위와도 같은 나 홀로 돌격을 하지 않을 것이라는 확신을 주기 위함이다.</figcaption></figure><p>어떤 맥락에서든, 충분히 오랫동안 조정게임이 이어진다면 정당성에 대한 개념이 확립될 가능성이 크다. 또한, 블록체인은 수 많은 조정게임들로 구성된다. 여러분은 어떤 클라이언트를 사용하고 있는가? .eth 와 관련된 주소를 관리하는 탈중앙 도메인 네임 레지스트리는 무엇인가? 수 많은 유니스왑(Uniswap) 컨트랙트의 복사본 중 어떤 컨트랙트를 진짜 유니스왑 거래소라고 생각하는가? 심지어 NFT 또한 일종의 조정게임이다. NFT의 가치를 구성하는 가장 중요한 두가지 요소는 첫째, NFT를 소유하고 있다는 자부심과 이를 다른 사람에게 과시할 수 있는 능력이고, 둘째, 이를 미래에 다시 팔 수 있을 것이라는 가능성이다. 이 두가지 요소 모두를 만족하기 위해 매우 중요한것이 바로 여러분이 구매한 NFT를 다른 모든 이들이 정당하다고(진품이라고) 여겨야 한다는 것이다. 이러한 모든 경우에서, 다른 모든 이들과 의견을 일치시키는 것은 큰 이익으로 이어지고, 이러한 상황을 이끄는 메커니즘은 매우 큰 힘을 갖는다.</p>\\n<h3>정당성 이론</h3>\\n<p>정당성이 형성되는 방법은 매우 다양하다. 일반적으로 어떠한 것이 정당성을 가질 때, 이것이 대부분의 사람들에게 심리적인 호소력이 있기 때문에 발생한다. 물론 사람들의 심리적 직관은 상당히 복잡하게 구성된다. 정당성에 대한 이론을 모두 나열하는 것은 불가능하지만, 우선 정당성을 형성하는 몇가지 방법들에 대해 살펴보자.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<strong>물리력에 의한 정당성</strong>: 누군가 힘을 과시하며 그 누구도 자신의 뜻을 거스를 수 없으며 모두 자신을 따라야 할 것이라고 엄포를 놓았다고 하자. 대부분의 이들은 다른 사람들 또한 이 사람에게 대항하지 않을 것이라 생각하기 때문에 힘을 과시한 이의 뜻을 따르게 될 것이다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>지속성에 의한 정당성</strong>: 만약 어떠한 것이 T라는 시점에 정당했다면, 이는 T+1 에서도 기본적으로 정당할 것이다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>공정성에 의한 정당성</strong>: 만약 어떤것이 공정하다는 직관적인 개념을 만족한다면 이는 정당하다고 할 수 있다. 자세한 내용은 <a href=\"https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/\">확실한 중립성에 대한 이전 글</a>을 참고하라. 물론, 확실한 중립성이 공정성의 유일한 개념은 아니다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>과정에 의한 정당성</strong>: 만약 어떤 과정이 정당하다면, 이 과정으로 인한 결과 또한 정당성을 얻는다. (예: 민주주의에 의해 제정된 법은 이러한 방식으로 정당성을 얻기도 한다.)</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>능력에 의한 정당성</strong>: 어떤 과정의 결과물이 많은 사람들을 만족 시킨다면, 이 과정은 정당성을 얻기도 한다. (예: 성공적인 독재는 이러한 방식으로 정당성을 얻기도 한다.)</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>참여에 의한 정당성</strong>: 만약 사람들이 어떠한 결과를 선택하는데 참여한다면, 이는 모두가 정당하다고 여길 가능성이 높다. 이는 공정성과 완전히 동일하지는 않지만 비슷한 측면이 있다. 이는 사람들이 심리적으로 자신의 과거의 행동과 일관되게 행동하려는 심리적 기제에 의존한다.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>정당성은 서술적 개념이라는 것에 주목해야 한다. 만약 개인적인 의견으로 어떤 것이 끔찍하다고 생각하더라도 여전히 그것은 정당할 수 있다. 반대로 충분히 많은 사람들이 어떠한 결과에 대해 끔찍하다고 생각한다면, 이에 대한 정당성은 점차 사라지게 될 것이고 끝내 완전히 없어지게 될 가능성이 매우 높다.</p>\\n<h3>정당성은 강력한 사회적 기술이며, 우리는 이를 적극 활용해야 한다</h3>\\n<p>안타깝게도 암호화폐 생태계에서 공공재에 대한 투자는 매우 부족한 것이 현실이다. 수천 조 단위의 자본이 이곳 저곳으로 흐르고 있지만, 정작 이 자본이 계속 유지되고 성장하기 위해 필요한 공공재에 대한 투자 금액은 매년 수천억원 정도에 불과하다.</p>\\n<p>이를 해결하기 위한 방법에는 크게 두가지가 있다. 첫번째는 비록 아주 효과적인 방법은 아니지만, 이러한 한계들을 극복하기 위해 커뮤니티가 열심히 노력하는 것에 자부심을 갖는 것이다. 주로 비트코인 커뮤니티가 취하고 있는 방법이다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JGLWo1UNg5ZR_8td8EZBMw.png\"></figure><p>자기 자신을 희생하며 코어 개발에 힘쓰고 있는 여러 팀들의 노력은 물론 칭찬 받아 마땅하다. 하지만 이와 비슷한 방식으로 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/50025543\">엘리우드 킵초게가 마라톤을 2시간 이내에 완주한 것</a> 또한 칭찬 받아 마땅하다. 엘리우드가 초인적인 능력을 보여주었다는 점은 매우 인상적이지만, 이와 별개로 엘리우드가 교통(암호화폐 생태계에서는 공공재에 대한 투자)의 미래가 될 수는 없다. 고도로 발전된 기술이 초인적인 능력과 수년간에 걸친 고된 훈련이 없어도 모든 사람들이 한 시간 이내에 42km를 이동할 수 있게 한 것처럼, <strong>필요한 규모의 공공재에 대한 투자를 이끌어내기 위해 우리는 더 발전된 사회적 기술을 구축하는데 힘써야 한다. 또한, 이는 단발성의 박애적 자선행위로 그쳐서는 안되고, 이 기술이 경제 시스템의 일부분으로 동작하게 해야 한다.</strong></p>\\n<p>이제 다시 암호화폐 이야기로 돌아가보자. 암호화폐(또는 도메인 네임, 가상 토지, NFT 등의 디지털 자산)의 가장 큰 힘은 어떤 한 개인이 막대한 자본을 기부하지 않아도 커뮤니티에서 이러한 자본을 이끌어 낼 수 있다는 것이다. 하지만 이렇게 형성된 자본은 정당성의 개념에 의해 제한된다. 예를 들어, 어떤 중앙화된 팀에 자본을 분배한다고 할 때, 이에 대한 커뮤니티의 합의가 충분히 이루어지지 않는다면 이러한 의사결정은 진행될 수 없을 것이다. 비트코인과 이더리움은 <a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/responding-to-51-attacks-in-casper-ffg/6363\">51% 공격을 방지하기 위해</a> 정당성의 개념에 이미 의존하고 있지만, 정당성을 통해 공공재에 대한 투자를 프로토콜 내부에서 이끌어내는 것은 더욱 어려운 일이다. 하지만, <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/growing-list-of-billion-dollar-crypto-unicorns-suggest-the-best-is-yet-to-come\">점차</a> 어플리케이션 레이어가 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million\">성장</a>하고 있고 이에 대한 새로운 프로토콜이 계속해서 개발되고 있다는 점에서, 우리는 공공재에 대한 투자를 보다 더 유연하게 이끌어 낼 수 있게 되었다.</p>\\n<h3>비트쉐어에서의 정당성</h3>\\n<p>오랫동안 잊혀져 있었던 아이디어 중 하나지만, 개인적으로 초기 암호화폐 업계에서 가장 혁신적이었던 아이디어는 <a href=\"https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?PHPSESSID=h7u4curkvqm5dn9gs9q3end8j0&amp;topic=5.0\">비트쉐어</a>의 <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20140209035756/https://invictus-innovations.com/social-consensus/\">사회 합의</a> 모델이라고 생각한다. 본질적으로, 비트쉐어는 생태계 내부의 새로운 프로젝트들을 집단적으로 지원하려는 사람들의(<a href=\"https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=1964.0\">PTS와 AGS 보유자</a>) 커뮤니티이다. 하지만, 어떠한 프로젝트가 이 생태계에서 환영받기 위해서는 해당 프로젝트 토큰 공급량의 10%를 PTS와 AGS 보유자에게 할당해야 한다.</p>\\n<p>물론, 누구나 PTS와 AGS 보유자에게 토큰을 할당하지 않고 프로젝트를 진행할 수 있고, 토큰을 할당한 프로젝트를 포크하여 토큰을 할당하지 않은 버전만 사용할 수도 있다. 하지만 이에 대해 댄 라리머는 아래와 같이 주장했다.</p>\\n<blockquote>다른 모든 이에게 강요할 순 없지만, 그래도 이 시장에서 가장 중요한건 바로 네트워크 효과다. 예를 들어, 엄청난 아이디어를 구현한다고 할 때, 이를 위한 새로운 블록체인을 만드는데 비용을 투자하지 않고, 해당 비용을 커뮤니티에 기여하는데 사용한다면 전체 PTS 커뮤니티의 지원을 받을 수 있을 것이다. 반대로 만약 이를 완전히 처음부터 개발한다면, 결국 새로운 커뮤니티를 구축하기 위해 많은 노력을 들여야 할 것이다. 나는 이러한 네트워크 효과로 인해 PTS 보유자에 혜택을 주는 프로젝트가 그렇지 않은 프로젝트에 비해 더 성공할 것이라 본다.</blockquote>\\n<p>댄 라리머의 주장 또한 정당성의 개념과 관련이 있다. PTS/AGS 보유자에게 토큰을 할당하는 모든 프로젝트는 커뮤니티의 지지와 관심을 받을 것이다. 또한, 다른 모든 커뮤니티 구성원들이 동일하게 관심을 가질 것이기 때문에, 각 커뮤니티 구성원 개인의 입장에서 관심을 가질 만한 가치가 있을 것이다. 반대로 토큰을 커뮤니티에 할당하지 않는 프로젝트들은 이러한 관심과 지원을 얻지 못할 것이다. <strong>물론, 우리가 원하는 정당성은 정확히 이러한 개념은 아니다. 이더리움 커뮤니티에는 비트쉐어와 같이 소규모 얼리 어답터들이 새로운 프로젝트에 관심을 갖게 할 만한 장치가 거의 없다. 하지만, 우리는 이러한 방식을 이더리움 커뮤니티에 훨씬 더 유용한 형태로 변형할 수 있다.</strong></p>\\n<h3>이더리움에 적용하기</h3>\\n<p>이더리움을 포함한 모든 블록체인 생태계는 자유와 탈중앙성을 중요한 가치로 둔다. 하지만 대부분의 블록체인에서 공공재 생태계는 아쉽게도 여전히 상당히 권위주의적이고, 중앙화 되어 있다. 이더리움, 지캐시(Zcash) 또는 다른 주요 블록체인에서, 대체로 하나(또는 최대 2~3개)의 팀이 다른 모든 이들을 합한것보다 훨씬 더 많은 비용을 지출하고 있으며, 공공재를 구축하고자 하는 다른 독립적인 팀들에게는 별 다른 선택지가 없는 상황이다. 나는 이러한 공공재에 대한 투자 모델을 “공공재 중앙 자본 조정자”(Central Capital Coordinators for Public-goods, CCCPs)라고 부르겠다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/395/0*RXmfyFU17bdsZogO.png\"></figure><p><strong>현재의 이런 상황이 생태계를 위해 최선을 다하고 있는 조직, 단체 또는 기관의 잘못은 아니다. 오히려 이러한 조직들은 생태계의 규약으로 인해 부당한 대우를 받았는데, 대체로 사람들은 이러한 조직에 지나치게 높은 평가 기준을 갖고 있기 때문이다.</strong> 모든 중앙화된 조직들은 필연적으로 사각지대가 존재할 수 밖에 없으며, 실제로는 중요하지만 이를 제대로 수행하지 못하는 여러 영역이나 팀들이 있을 수 밖에 없다. 이는 이와 관련된 사람들의 능력이 부족했기 때문이 아니라, 이러한 완벽함은 소규모 조직의 능력 밖의 영역이기 때문이다. 따라서, 공공재에 대한 투자를 위해 보다 다양하고 탄력적인 접근 방식을 취하여 이러한 소규모 단일 조직에 대한 부담을 덜어줄 필요가 있다.</p>\\n<p>다행히, 우리는 이미 그러한 방법의 단초를 갖고 있다. 이더리움의 어플리케이션 레이어는 계속해서 발전하고 있으며, 이미 공공의 정신(public-spiritedness)을 보여주고 있다. 노시스(Gnosis)와 같은 기업들은 이더리움 클라이언트 개발에 기여하고 있으며, 다양한 디파이(DeFi) 프로젝트들은 깃코인(Gitcoin) 매칭 풀에 수십만 달러를 기부하였다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*uLIxfMSbB_jWesJP.png\"></figure><p>깃코인 그랜츠(Gitcoin Grants)는 이미 높은 수준의 정당성을 확보하였다. 깃코인의 공공재 펀딩 메커니즘인 <a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html\">쿼드라틱 펀딩(quadratic funding)</a>은 <a href=\"https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/\">확실한 중립성(credibly neutral)</a>을 보여주었고, 커뮤니티의 우선순위와 가치들을 효과적으로 반영하며 기존의 펀딩 메커니즘으로 메울 수 없었던 빈틈을 잘 보완할 수 있다는 것을 보여주었다. 또한, 상위 깃코인 그랜츠 매칭 수여자들은 다른 중앙화된 그랜츠 수여 단체들에게 좋은 영감이 되기도 한다. 이더리움 재단 또한 몰록다오(MolochDAO) 등과 함께 깃코인 그랜츠와 같은 프로젝트를 육성하여 이러한 실험과 다양성을 지원하는데 핵심적인 역할을 해왔으며, 계속해서 더 많은 커뮤니티의 지원을 받고 있다.</p>\\n<p>우리는 비트쉐어 모델을 수정 및 도입하여 초기 공공재 투자 생태계를 더 탄탄하게 구축할 수 있다. 2013년에 PTS와 AGS를 구매한 소규모 집단에 토큰을 할당한 프로젝트에 강력한 커뮤니티 지원을 제공하는 대신에, <strong>자금의 일부를 해당 프로젝트가 속한 생태계의 공공재 부문에 투자하는 프로젝트를 강력하게 지원할 수 있다.</strong> 또한, 가장 중요한 것은, 기존 프로젝트를 포크했지만 그 가치를 생태계를 위해 투자하지 않는 프로젝트에는 이러한 혜택을 제공하지 않을 수 있다는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>공공재를 지원하기 위한 방법에는 여러가지가 있다. 깃코인 그랜츠 매칭 풀에 대한 장기적인 지원, 이더리움 클라이언트 개발 지원(이더리움 클라이언트가 무엇인지에 대한 명확한 정의가 있기 때문에 확실한 중립성을 갖는 작업이라 할 수 있다.) 또는 특정 어플리케이션 프로젝트 영역을 벗어난 범위에서 또 다른 독자적인 그랜츠 프로그램을 운영하는 방법들이 있을 수 있다. 특정 프로젝트가 생태계에 충분한 지원과 기여를 했는지 판단하는 가장 쉬운 방법 은 투자 금액을 기준으로 삼는 것이다. 예를 들어, 프로젝트 예산의 5%는 생태계에 기여하기 위해서 사용되고, 1%는 블록체인 외부의 공공재를 위해 사용되며, 해당 투자금이 필요한 영역에 사용될 것이라는 믿음이 있다면, 우리는 이에 대해 보다 쉽게 판단할 수 있을 것이다.</p>\\n<h3>커뮤니티는 실제로 많은 영향력이 있는가?</h3>\\n<p>물론 이런 방식의 커뮤니티 지원에는 분명히 한계가 존재한다. 경쟁 프로젝트(또는 기존 프로젝트의 포크 버전)가 사용자에게 더 나은 서비스를 제공한다면, 다른 많은 사람들이 생태계에 더 많이 기여하는 프로젝트를 사용해야 한다고 주장하더라도, 사용자들은 서비스가 더 나은 프로젝트를 사용할 것이다.</p>\\n<p>하지만 우리는 이러한 한계를 다른 맥락에서 해결할 수 있다. 때로는 커뮤니티의 영향력이 약하기도 하지만, 때로는 상당히 강할때도 있다. 이와 관련한 흥미로운 사례중 하나는 <a href=\"https://tether.to/\">테더(Tether)</a> vs <a href=\"https://makerdao.com/\">다이(DAI)</a> 이다. 트레이더들은 테더에 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4403640-tethers-credibility-and-impact-on-bitcoin\">많은 논란</a>이 있음에도 불구하고 달러를 보유하고 송금하기 위해 테더를 사용한다. 다이가 테더에 비해 상대적으로 더 탈중앙화 되어 있고 투명하게 작동한다는 장점에도 불구하고, 트레이더들은 다이가 아닌 테더를 사용하므로 다이가 테더보다 높은 시장점유율을 확보하는것은 현실적으로 어렵다. 하지만 다이는 어플리케이션 영역에서 빛을 발하고 있다. <a href=\"https://augur2.eth.link/#!/markets\">어거</a>도 다이를 사용하고, <a href=\"https://www.xdaichain.com/\">엑스다이(xDai)</a>도 다이를 사용하며, <a href=\"https://app.pooltogether.com/\">풀투게더(PoolTogether)</a> 또한 다이를 사용한다. 또한 <a href=\"http://zk.money/\">zk.money</a>도 DAI를 사용할 예정이다. 이외에도 <a href=\"https://github.com/makerdao/awesome-makerdao#dai-1\">수 많은 프로젝트들이 DAI를 사용</a>하고 있거나 사용할 예정이다. 테더(USDT)를 사용하는 댑(Dapp)은 얼마나 있는가? 매우 적을 것이다.</p>\\n<p>정리하면, 커뮤니티 기반의 정당성이 갖는 힘이 무한한것은 아니지만, 그럼에도 불구하고 상당한 활용 여지는 있다. 이는 각 프로젝트들이 예산의 일부를 생태계를 위해 사용하도록 장려하기에 충분하다. 또한, 각 프로젝트들이 이러한 균형에 응하는(정당성을 따르는) 이기적인 이유도 존재한다. 만약 여러분이 이더리움 지갑의 개발자이거나, 팟캐스트나 뉴스레터의 저자라고 해보자. 두개의 경쟁 프로젝트가 있을 때, 하나는 여러분을 포함한 생태계를 위한 공공재에 크게 기여하고 있고, 다른 하나는 그렇지 않다고 하자. 이 때 여러분은 어떤 프로젝트가 더 높은 시장 점유율을 확보할 수 있도록 도와 주겠는가?</p>\\n<h3>NFTs: 이더리움 너머의 공공재를 지원하다</h3>\\n<p>정당성의 개념을 근거로 한 이더로부터 창출된 가치를 공공재에 기여하는 행위는 이더리움 생태계에 국한되지 않으며, 더 큰 가치를 갖는다. 현재 우리가 당면해 있는 가장 중요한 도전과 기회는 바로 NFT이다. NFT는 여러 공공재 부문과 특히 창조적 다양성 부분에서 크게 도움이 될 것으로 보이며, 이들의 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons\">만성적이고 구조적인 자금 부족 문제</a>를 최소한 부분적으로 해결할 수 있을 가능성이 높다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/770/0*q8djcTWUnoMVTrnV.png\"><figcaption>아주 훌륭한 첫 걸음.</figcaption></figure><p>하지만 우리는 이 기회를 놓치게 될 수도 있다. 일론 머스크가 자신의 트윗을 판매해서 백만 달러를 벌어 자기 자신을 위해 사용한다면, 사회적 측면에서 이는 가치가 거의 없다고 할 수 있다. 물론, 일론은 결국 <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/elon-musk-turns-down-1-million-offer-to-buy-his-tweet-as-an-nft.html\">NFT를 팔지 않기</a>로 했고, 이는 분명히 칭찬 받아 마땅하다. 만약 NFT가 이미 부유한 셀럽들에게 더 큰 부를 가져다 주는 카지노가 된다면, 이는 그렇게 썩 흥미로운 결과는 아닐 것이다.</p>\\n<p><strong>다행히도, 우리는 이러한 결과를 바꿀 수 있는 힘이 있다.</strong> 특정 NFT는 많은 사람들이 구매 하고 싶어하고, 다른 NFT는 그렇지 않을 때, 이 둘 사이를 구분짓는 것은 결국 정당성에 대한 것이다. 만약 모든 사람이 어떤 NFT는 흥미롭고 다른 것은 그렇지 않다고 생각한다면, 사람들은 모두 전자를 구매하려고 할 것이다. 전자를 구매 했을 때, 해당 NFT를 보유하고 있다는 자부심과 함께 이를 뽐낼 수 있는 권한을 가지며, 다른 모든 이들도 이와 동일하게 생각할 것이므로 이들에게 NFT를 되 팔기도 쉬울 것이기 때문이다. NFT에 대한 정당성의 개념이 바람직한 방향으로 형성된다면, NFT는 예술가, 자선 단체 등에게 탄탄한 자금원을 구축할 수 있는 기회가 될 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>이와 관련하여 생각해 볼 수 있는 두가지 아이디어가 있다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>일부 기관(심지어 DAO도)은 수익의 일부분이 자선적인 목적으로 사용 되어 다양한 집단에게 이익이 될 것임을 보장한다면, 이러한 NFT를 “축성(bless)”할 수도 있다. 이러한 축성은 다음과 같이 이에 대한 공식적인 분류를 만들어 낼 수도 있다. 해당 NFT는 세계 빈곤 구제, 과학 연구, 창조 예술, 지역 저널리즘, 오픈소스 소프트웨어 개발, 소외된 지역사회에 대한 지원 또는 다른 가치 있는 것들에 기여하고 있는가?</li>\\n<li>소셜 미디어 플랫폼과 협력하여 NFT가 사람들의 개인 프로필에 잘 드러날 수 있게 하여, NFT의 구매자들이 중요하게 생각하는 가치를 단지 말이 아니라 힘들게 얻어낸 돈을 통해 보여줄 수 있는 방법을 제공할 수 있다. 이는 (1)과 결합되어 사용자들로 하여금 사회적 가치에 더 기여하도록 넛지(nudge)할 수 있다.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>이외에도 다른 아이디어들이 있지만, 분명한 것은 이 분야에 더 많은 조정 및 연구가 이뤄질 만한 가치가 있다는 것이다.</p>\\n<h3>정리</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>정당성(고차원적 수용)의 개념은 매우 강력하다. 정당성은 <a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/09/11/coordination.html\">조정</a>이 있는 모든 곳에서 나타나고, 특히 인터넷에서 조정은 어디에나 있다.</li>\\n<li>정당성이 형성될 수 있는 방식은 여러가지가 있다. 그 중 중요한 것들은 <strong>물리력, 지속성, 공정성, 과정, 능력, 참여</strong>이다.</li>\\n<li>암호화폐는 우리가 집단 경제 의지에 의해 대규모 자본을 이끌어 낼 수 있게 한다는 측면에서 매우 강력한 힘을 갖고 있다. 또한, 이러한 자본은 초기에는 어떤 특정 개인에 의해 움직이지 않는다. <strong>이러한 자본을 움직이게 만드는 힘은 바로 정당성이다.</strong>\\n</li>\\n<li>공공재에 대한 투자를 위해 베이스 레이어(base layer)에서 토큰을 공급하는 것은 매우 위험하다. 이더리움은 매우 풍부한 <strong>어플리케이션 생태계</strong>를 갖고 있고, 우리는 이를 이용해 훨씬 더 유연하게 재원을 마련할 수 있다. 이는 기존 프로젝트에 영향을 줄 수 있을 뿐만 아니라, 미래의 새로운 프로젝트에도 영향을 미칠 수 있다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>커뮤니티의 공공재에 기여하는 어플리케이션 프로젝트는 더 많은 커뮤니티의 지원을 받을 것이다. </strong>그리고<strong> </strong>이는 매우 중요하다. 다이 예시가 이러한 기여가 얼마나 중요한지를 보여 준다.</li>\\n<li>이더리움 생태계는 메커니즘 디자인과 소셜 레이어의 혁신에 힘쓰고 있다. <strong>이더리움 생태계 내부의 공공재 펀딩 챌린지는 좋은 시작점이다!</strong>\\n</li>\\n<li>하지만 이는 단순히 이더리움에만 국한되는 이야기는 아니다. NFT는 정당성에 따라 움직이는 대규모 자본의 한 예시일 뿐이다. NFT 산업은 단순히 가상세계를 넘어 예술가, 자선 단체 및 공공재 공급자에게 큰 도움이 될 수 있다. <strong>하지만 이는 아직 결정되지 않은 미래다. 이는 앞으로의 활발한 조정과 지원에 달려 있다.</strong>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=590a55668218\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/onther-tech/%EB%B8%94%EB%A1%9D%EC%B2%B4%EC%9D%B8%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C-%EA%B0%80%EC%9E%A5-%EC%A4%91%EC%9A%94%ED%95%9C-%EA%B2%83%EC%9D%80-%EC%A0%95%EB%8B%B9%EC%84%B1-%ED%99%95%EB%B3%B4%EB%8B%A4-the-most-important-scarce-resource-is-legitimacy-590a55668218\">블록체인에서 가장 중요한 것은 정당성 확보다(The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy)</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/onther-tech\">Onther</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\\n',\n                enclosure: {},\n                categories: [\n                  \"ethereum\",\n                  \"research\",\n                  \"legitimacy\",\n                  \"tokamak-network\",\n                  \"blockchain\",\n                ],\n              },\n              {\n                title: \"Announcement of NFT Event 1st week winner\",\n                pubDate: \"2021-04-16 09:38:29\",\n                link:\n                  \"https://medium.com/onther-tech/announcement-of-nft-event-1st-week-winner-a91e4ebf3c08?source=rss----eb8117f0bafd---4\",\n                guid: \"https://medium.com/p/a91e4ebf3c08\",\n                author: \"Onther\",\n                thumbnail:\n                  \"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rpxl4-1_V2kyw4QAAts4gw.png\",\n                description:\n                  '\\n<h3>Announcement of NFT Event 1st week winner [EN/KR]</h3>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rpxl4-1_V2kyw4QAAts4gw.png\"></figure><p>Hello!

Theoretic Approach for More Verifiable Rollup</h3>\\n<h3>Intro</h3>\\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/optimistic_rollups/\">옵티미스틱 롤업(Optimistic Rollup, 이하 롤업)</a>은 이더리움 커뮤니티가 레이어 2 솔루션인 <a href=\"https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/plasma/\">플라즈마</a>의 문제점을 해결하기 위해 고민하고 있을 때, 이를 해결하기 위해 혜성처럼 등장한 또 다른 레이어 2 솔루션이다. 롤업의 가장 큰 장점은 플라즈마와 달리 <a href=\"https://medium.com/starkware/validity-proofs-vs-fraud-proofs-4ef8b4d3d87a\">위조 증명(Fraud Proof)</a>을 통해 모든 사용자가 롤업을 감시하지 않고, 최소한 단 한명의 정직한 검증자만 있다면 안전성(Security)을 보장할 수 있다는 것이다. 이는 롤업이 플라즈마에 비해 확장성을 대폭 희생한다는 단점에도 불구하고, 이더리움 커뮤니티의 전폭적인 지지를 얻게된 주요 요인이었다.</p>\\n<p>롤업은 말 그대로 단 한명의 정직한 검증자(Honest Verifier)만 존재해도 안전하게 동작할 수 있는 아주 매력적인 레이어 2 이다. 하지만 블록체인 세계에 살고 있는 우리는 의심이 아주 많은 사람들이기 때문에, 롤업이 정말 안전하게 작동한다고 확신할 수 있는가에 대한 의문이 생긴다. 사실 이런 의문들은 아주 새로운 것은 아니다. 검증자의 딜레마(Verifier’s Dilemma)라는 개념으로 꽤 오랜 기간동안 많은 연구자들은 롤업 뿐 아니라 검증이 필요한 다양한 분야에서 올바르게 검증이 이루어질 수 있는가에 대해 논의해왔다. 롤업 또한 이와 비슷한 논의가 이루어져 왔고, 이에 대한 의견은 크게 두 갈래로 나뉜다. 한 쪽은 롤업에서 <a href=\"https://research.paradigm.xyz/rollups\">검증자의 딜레마를 ‘전혀’ 고려할 필요가 없다고 주장하며</a>, 다른 한 쪽은 롤업이 장기적으로 안전하게 동작하기 위해서는 <a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html\">반드시 검증자의 딜레마를 고려해야 한다고 이야기 한다.</a></p>\\n<p>도대체 누구의 말이 맞는 것일까? 설계자가 아닌 사용자의 입장에서 우리는 롤업을 정말 안전하게 사용할 수 있는 것인가? 만약에 확실히 안전한것이 아니라면 우리는 어떻게 해야 하는가? 이 글에서는 이러한 모든 의문들을 모두 해소하고, 롤업의 안전성을 보장하기 위해 장기적으로 어떠한 방향으로 나아가야 할지에 대한 구체적인 방법을 제시할 것이다.</p>\\n<p><em>이 글에서 다루는 모든 논의들은 비단 옵티미스틱 롤업뿐만 아니라 위조 증명(Fruad Proof)을 이용하는 모든 확장성 솔루션에 적용 될 수 있다.</em></p>\\n<h3>Verifier’s Dilemma</h3>\\n<p>롤업의 안전성에 대한 문제를 다루기 전에 반드시 짚고 넘어가야할 개념이 있다. 바로 앞서 소개글에서도 언급 했던 검증자의 딜레마이다. 검증자의 딜레마란 일반적으로 블록체인 세계에서 한 참가자가 어떠한 연산을 수행하고 다른 한 참가자가 해당 작업을 검증하여 네트워크 혹은 프로토콜의 안전성을 유지할 때, 검증에 대한 효용이 명확하지 않은 경우에 발생하는 일련의 문제들을 의미한다.</p>\\n<p>검증자의 딜레마는 <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/702.pdf\">이 글</a>에서 최초로 논의된 개념으로 쉽게 풀어 쓰면 다음과 같이 설명할 수 있다. 비트코인과 이더리움과 같은 블록체인에서는 블록을 최초로 마이닝한 마이너가 네트워크의 다른 노드에게 블록을 전파할 때, 다른 노드들은 모두 블록의 유효성을 검증한다. 이것이 원래 컨센서스가 의도한 바이며, 네트워크의 안전성 측면에서 블록을 전파받은 모든 다른 노드들은 이를 반드시 검증하는것이 바람직하다.</p>\\n<p>하지만 개별 노드의 연산력은 유한하기 때문에 복잡한 트랜잭션을 검증하는데 사용될 연산력을 다음 블록을 마이닝하는 작업에 할당하는것이 경제적으로 더 유리할 수 있다. 물론, 유효하지 않은 블록을 조상 블록으로 하는 블록은 네트워크에서 인정받을 수 없기 때문에 이러한 위험을 감수해야 한다. 따라서, 개별 노드들은 검증을 수행하는것이 유리한지, 혹은 검증을 하지 않고 마이닝에만 집중하는것이 유리한지 선택해야하는 상황에 끊임 없이 빠지게 된다.</p>\\n<p>이러한 검증자의 딜레마는 롤업에서도 유사한 방식으로 적용될 수 있다. 롤업에서는 시퀀서가 레이어 2에서 발생한 트랜잭션들을 처리한 후, 해당 상태값들의 요약본과 개별 트랜잭션 데이터만을 레이어 1에 제출한다.</p>\\n<p><em>시퀀서 또는 오퍼레이터는 롤업에서 사용자의 트랜잭션의 순서를 결정하고, 이를 레이어 1에 제출하는 역할을 수행한다. 이 글에서는 시퀀서라는 용어를 사용한다.</em></p>\\n<p>이 때 시퀀서가 올바르지 않은 상태값을 제출할 수 있기 때문에, 롤업에서는 <a href=\"https://medium.com/starkware/validity-proofs-vs-fraud-proofs-4ef8b4d3d87a\">위조 증명(Fraud Proof)</a>과 DTD(Dispute Time Delay)를 두어 이를 예방한다. 롤업 내외부의 모든 사용자들은 롤업의 검증자가 될 수 있으며, 위조 증명을 통해 DTD내에 유효하지 않은 값이 확정(Finalize)되는 것을 방지할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>만약 검증자가 위조 증명에 성공한다면 시퀀서가 예치한 보증금의 일부 혹은 전부를 보상으로 받을 수 있다. 하지만 여기서 한가지 문제가 발생한다. 만약에 시퀀서가 항상 올바른 값만 제출한다면? 검증자는 아무리 검증 작업을 수행해도 위조 증명을 성공하지 못할 것이고, 이는 곧 검증에 대한 유인을 잃게 만든다. 하지만 시퀀서가 계속해서 올바른 값만 제출하는것이 원래 롤업이 의도한 안전성이 아니냐고 반문할 수 있다. 이것이 왜 문제가 되는지 살펴보자.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>검증자는 시퀀서가 제출한 상태값이 올바른지 항상 검증한다.</li>\\n<li>시퀀서는 올바르지 않은 값을 제출하면 위조 증명에 의해 보증금을 몰수 당하므로 계속해서 올바른 상태값만 제출한다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>검증자는 시퀀서가 계속해서 올바른 값만 제출하므로 검증 작업에 대한 보상을 받을 수 없다.</strong> 따라서 검증을 포기한다.</li>\\n<li>검증자가 검증을 포기했으므로 시퀀서는 롤업을 공격하여 사용자들의 자산을 탈취할 강력한 유인을 갖게 된다.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>요컨대, 검증에 대한 경제적인 유인은 시퀀서의 공격 행위에 강력하게 의존하기 때문에, 시퀀서가 공격을 하지 않을수록, 다시 말해 롤업이 안전하게 운영 될수록 검증에 대한 유인은 더 감소하게 된다는 것이다. 이는 굉장히 역설적인데, 롤업이 안전해질수록 더 위험해지고, 더 위험해질수록 더 안전해지기 때문이다. 이 논리에 따르면, 한눈에 봐도 검증자의 딜레마는 롤업의 안전성을 심각하게 위해할 수 있는 요소로 보인다. 과연 검증자의 딜레마는 정말 롤업의 위협요소일까? 다음 장에서 더 깊게 파헤쳐보자.</p>\\n<h3>Super-Simple Model</h3>\\n<p>복잡한 개념이나 문제를 이해하고 해결하기 위해서 가장 좋은 방법은 언제나 문제를 단순화하는 것이다. 따라서 우리는 롤업의 검증자의 딜레마에 대해 본격적으로 논의하기에 앞서, 이를 매우 단순화한 Super-Simple Model을 먼저 살펴볼 것이다.</p>\\n<p>Super-Simple Model<em>은 Ed Felten의 글 </em><a href=\"https://medium.com/offchainlabs/the-cheater-checking-problem-why-the-verifiers-dilemma-is-harder-than-you-think-9c7156505ca1\"><em>The Cheater Checking Problem: Why the Verifier’s Dilemma is Harder Than You Think</em></a><em> 을 바탕으로 작성되었다.</em></p>\\n<p><strong><em>가정: 이 글에서 다룰 모든 모델에서 모든 참가자 또는 경기자의 합리성이 </em></strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)\"><strong><em>주지사실(common knowledge)</em></strong></a><strong><em>임을 가정한다. 이는 다음의 두 무한명제가 참(True)임을 뜻한다.</em></strong></p>\\n<p><em>‘당신이 합리적이라는 사실을 나는 알고 있다.</em></p>\\n<p><em>당신이 합리적이라는 사실을 내가 안다는 사실을 당신이 알고 있다.</em></p>\\n<p><em>당신이 합리적이라는 사실을 내가 안다는 사실을 당신이 안다는 사실을 나는 알고 있다. …’</em></p>\\n<p><em>‘내가 합리적이라는 사실을 당신은 알고 있다.</em></p>\\n<p><em>내가 합리적이라는 사실을 당신이 안다는 사실을 나는 알고 있다.</em></p>\\n<p><em>내가 합리적이라는 사실을 당신이 안다는 사실을 내가 안다는 사실을 당신은 알고 있다. …..’</em></p>\\n<p>먼저, 아주 단순한 시스템을 생각해보자. 이 시스템에는 두명의 경기자가 존재하는데, 한명은 주장자(Asserter, 이하 A)로 단순히 참 혹은 거짓만 제시한다. 다른 한명은 검증자(Verifier, 이하 V)로 검증에 필요한 비용을 지불하고 A의 주장을 검증하거나 또는 A가 참을 주장했을 것이라 가정하고 검증하지 않는 것을 선택할 수 있다. 만약 A의 주장이 거짓이고 V가 이를 검증하는데 성공했다면 A의 보증금을 보상으로 받게 된다.</p>\\n<p>반대로 A가 거짓을 주장했음에도 불구하고 V가 이를 고발하지 않는다면 V의 보증금이 A에게 보상으로 주어진다. 즉, 이 시스템의 목적은 A가 거짓 주장을 하더라도 V가 이를 검증하여 항상 참만 주장되도록 유지하는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>이러한 목적을 달성하기 위해 우리가 고려해야 할 위험요소는 두가지가 있다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>뇌물 수수 공격(Bribery attack)</li>\\n<li>검증자의 나태(Laziness)</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>뇌물 수수 공격은 주장자가 검증자를 뇌물로 매수하여 거짓을 주장하더라도 이를 검증하지 않도록 사전에 합의하는 것을 말한다. 이러한 공격 방식은 주장자와 검증자의 담보물의 가치를 높이거나 이해관계자의 수를 늘리는 것으로 비교적 쉽게 해결이 가능하다.</p>\\n<p>검증자의 나태는 말 그대로 검증자가 검증작업을 수행하지 않아 발생하는 문제를 의미한다. 검증 작업이 수행되지 않는다면, 주장자는 얼마든지 거짓을 계속해서 주장할 수 있게 된다. 검증자의 나태는 뇌물 수수 공격과 달리 담보물의 가치를 높이거나 이해관계자의 수를 단순히 늘리는 것으로는 해결이 쉽지 않다. 그 이유를 아래에서 자세히 살펴보도록 하자.</p>\\n<p>검증자의 나태를 막기 위해서는 먼저 검증자가 어떠한 기준으로 검증 또는 비검증 전략을 선택하는지 파악할 필요가 있다.</p>\\n<p>다음과 같은 조건하에 검증자가 각 전략을 선택했을 때의 기대 보수는 아래와 같이 나타낼 수 있다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>R = A의 보증금, A가 거짓을 주장하고 V가 검증에 성공할 경우 V에게 보상으로 주어진다.</li>\\n<li>L = V의 보증금, A가 거짓을 주장하고 V가 검증에 실패할 경우 A에게 보상으로 주어진다.</li>\\n<li>X = A가 공격할 확률</li>\\n<li>C = 검증 비용</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ol>\\n<li>검증 기대 보수: R*X-C</li>\\n<li>비검증 기대 보수: -L*X</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>이 때, 우리는 V의 검증 보수가 비검증 보수보다 크다면<strong>(R*X- C &gt; -L*X)</strong> V는 항상 A의 주장을 검증을 할 것이라 쉽게 예측할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>즉, <strong>X &gt; C/(R+L)</strong> 이면 검증자의 나태를 방지할 수 있는 것이다. 반대로 <strong>X &lt; C/(R+L)</strong><em>라면 V는 A의 주장을 검증하지 않을 것이다. (두 항이 같은 경우는 어떤 선택을 하더라도 기대 보수가 무차별해지는 지점이다. 즉 V는 A의 주장을 검증할수도 있고, 하지 않을수도 있다.)</em></p>\\n<p>그렇다면 우리에게 필요한것은 <strong>X를 C/(R+L)보다 더 크게 만드는 것이다.</strong> 그러면 V는 항상 A의 주장을 검증하게 될 것이고 이 단순한 시스템은 항상 안전하게 유지될 것이다!</p>\\n<p>하지만 문제는 X는 A의 공격 확률을 의미하고, 이는 곧 <strong>X의 값은 A에 의해 결정</strong>된다는 것이다. 만약 X가 충분히 낮도록 A가 공격행위의 빈도수와 시기를 적절하게 조절한다면 V는 검증 효용이 비검증 효용보다 낮기 때문에 검증하지 않는 것을 선택하게 되고, A의 거짓 주장을 효과적으로 방어할 수 없게 된다. 이는 곧 이 단순한 시스템의 안전성이 무너질 수 있다는것을 의미한다.</p>\\n<p>여기서 누군가는 “R+L을 최대한 높여 효과적인 X의 수치를 충분히 낮추게 되면 시스템은 더 안전해질 수 있다”고 주장할 것이다. 다시 말해, 이 시스템의 참여 조건에 해당하는 자본 제한(Capital Requirement)을 가능한 최대로 늘려 A와 V의 요구 보증금액을 높이자는 것이다. 하지만 이는 다음과 같은 두가지 측면에서 한계가 분명하다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>R과 L이 아무리 높은 수치라도, 그 수치가 사전에 결정되는 순간 A는 효과적인 공격 확률을 계산할 수 있다. 이를 통해 A는 여전히 V의 검증에 대한 유인을 감소시킬 수 있다.</li>\\n<li>자본 제한을 높이는 것은 참여에 대한 진입장벽을 높여 오직 소수만이 이 시스템에 참여할 수 있게 제한한다. 이는 곧 해당 시스템의 도입과 확장에 매우 부정적인 영향을 끼치게 된다.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>또 다른 아이디어는 검증자의 수를 늘리면 이 딜레마를 해결할 수 있다는 것이다. <strong>하지만 검증자의 수를 단순히 늘리는 것은 뇌물수수 공격(Bribery attack)을 예방하는 것에는 큰 도움이 되지만, 검증자의 나태를 해결하는 것에는 오히려 악영향을 끼치게 된다.</strong></p>\\n<p>뇌물 수수 공격을 예방하는데 도움이 되는 이유는, 주장자가 검증자를 매수하기 위해서는 각 검증자에게 R보다 큰 보상을 지급해야 하기 때문이다. 만약 검증자의 수가 N명이고, 거짓을 주장하여 얻는 총 이익이 M이라고 할 때, M/N &gt; R 일 경우에만 모든 검증자들을 매수할 수 있을 것이다. 따라서 N이 커질수록 주장자는 뇌물 수수 공격을 수행하는것이 어려워진다.</p>\\n<p><em>이론적으로 롤업에서 단 한명의 검증자만 있어도 안전하게 동작할 수 있지만, 반대로 이는 시퀀서의 뇌물수수 공격에 취약해질 수 있기 때문에 가능한 다수의 올바른 검증자를 확보하는것이 매우 중요하다고 할 수 있다.</em></p>\\n<p>반대로, 검증자의 수를 늘리는 것이 검증자의 나태를 해결하는 것에 별 도움이 안되는 이유는 검증자의 수가 증가할수록 비검증 효용은 그대로인 반면, <strong>검증에 대한 기대 보상은 검증자의 수에 비례하여 감소하기 때문이다.</strong> 이는 매우 자명한 사실인데, 예를 들어, 검증자가 두명일 때 두 검증자 모두 검증에 성공한다면 보상 R을 어떠한 비율(K)로든 나누게 될 것이고, 이는 검증자가 단 한명일 때의 보상 R보다 낮은 금액(R/K)일 것이기 때문이다.</p>\\n<p>이 단순한 모델에 따르면, 검증자의 딜레마란 꽤 복잡한 문제이며 이를 해결하는것은 상당히 어려워 보인다. 하지만 이 모델은 정확히 롤업을 모방한것은 아니다. 롤업에서는 이러한 문제가 해결될수도 있지 않을까? 이에 대해 다음 장에서 더 자세히 살펴보도록 하자.</p>\\n<h3>Super-Simple Model in Optimistic Rollup</h3>\\n<p>앞서 다루었던 단순한 모델을 바탕으로 롤업에서의 Super-Simple Model을 구성하여 롤업에서 검증자의 딜레마와 관련하여 어떠한 문제가 있을지 살펴보자. 사실 앞의 모델에서 변경되는 부분은 많지 않다. 주장자가 시퀀서(Sequencer, S)로, 검증자는 그대로 검증자가 된다. 이 때 검증자는 롤업의 이해관계자라고 가정한다. 즉, 검증자는 롤업에 일정한 경제적/비경제적 자산이 있거나, 롤업을 통해 주기적으로 일정한 경제적/비경제적 수익을 얻는 자이다.</p>\\n<p>이 때, 다음과 같은 조건하에 검증자 V의 검증 및 비검증 기대보수는 다음과 같다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>R = S의 보증금, V가 검증에 성공할 시 V에게 보상으로 주어진다.</li>\\n<li>L = V의 롤업에 예치된 자산, V가 검증에 실패할 시 S에게 보상으로 주어질 수 있다.</li>\\n<li>X = S가 공격할 확률</li>\\n<li>C = 검증 비용</li>\\n<li>F = 검증 단위당 V가 얻는 수익(예를 들어, V가 롤업의 트랜잭션 T마다 일정한 수익을 얻을 때, 이를 F라고 한다)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>단, R,L &gt; F &gt; C &gt; 0 이다.</em></p>\\n<p><em>또한 편의상 F는 L에 누적해서 포함되지 않는다고 가정하겠다. 이러한 가정은 이후에 다룰 모든 모델에서 동일하게 적용될 것이다.</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>검증 기대 보수: R*X + F -C</li>\\n<li>비검증 기대 보수: -L*X + (1-X)F</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><em>검증을 하지 않더라도 시퀀서가 공격 행위를 수행하지 않으면 검증자는 여전히 F의 수익을 얻을 수 있다는것에 유의하라.</em></p>\\n<p>이 때, Super-Simple Model과 동일하게 검증 보수가 비검증 보수보다 크다면 검증자는 항상 검증할 유인이 있다고 할 수 있다. 즉, 시퀀서의 공격확률이 다음과 같은 경우에 검증자는 검증 전략을 선택하게 된다.</p>\\n<ul><li><strong>X &gt; C/(R+L+F)</strong></li></ul>\\n<p>이전의 모델과 달라진 것은 오직 분모에 F가 추가되었다는 것이다. 이는 시퀀서의 공격확률을 소폭 감소시키는 효과를 낼 수 있겠지만, 근본적인 문제점은 동일하게 존재한다.</p>\\n<p>즉, <strong>검증자의 전략적 선택은 여전히 시퀀서의 공격 확률에 의존</strong>하고 있으며, 이는 새로운 변수인 검증 단위당 검증자가 얻는 일정한 수익(F)을 고려하더라도 크게 달라지지 않는다는것을 알 수 있다. 이는 시퀀서의 공격이 매우 간헐적으로 일어나거나 또는 일어나지 않는다면, 검증자는 검증 비용 없이 계속해서 온전한 수익을 얻을 수 있기 때문이다.</p>\\n<p>우리는 어떻게 이 문제를 해결할 수 있을까? R과 L, 즉 자본 제한을 높이는 방법은 명확한 한계가 있다는 것은 이미 논의가 되었다. 한가지 우리가 생각할 수 있는 것은 롤업이 다수의 검증자들 중 단 한명의 검증자 만이라도 검증을 올바르게 수행하면 시스템의 안전성이 유지될 수 있다는 것이다. 그렇다면 단순한 모델에서 확장된 모델로 변경하여 검증자의 수를 늘리면 이들 중 누군가 한명쯤은 검증을 할 것이라 기대할 수 있지 않을까? 그리하여 롤업의 안전성도 지켜질 수 있지 않을까?</p>\\n<h3>Multiple Verifiers</h3>\\n<p>본격적으로 검증자의 수를 다수(N)로 늘리기 전에 먼저 이를 아주 단순화한 모델로부터 시작해보자. 즉, 검증자는 이제 1명이 아니라 <strong>단 2명</strong>이다. 두명의 검증자는 V1, V2이고, 시퀀서 S는 여전히 동일하다.</p>\\n<p>이 때, 다음과 같은 조건하에 각 검증자의 검증 및 비검증 기대 보수는 다음과 같이 나타낼 수 있다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>R = S의 보증금, V가 검증에 성공할 시 V에게 보상으로 주어진다.</li>\\n<li>L = V(N)의 롤업에 예치된 자산, V가 검증에 실패할 시 S에게 보상으로 주어질 수 있다. (두 검증자의 L은 같다고 가정한다.)</li>\\n<li>X = S가 공격할 확률</li>\\n<li>Y = 상대 검증자가 검증할 확률(예를 들어, V1의 관점에서 V2가 항상 검증할것임을 확신한다면 Y = 1이다.)</li>\\n<li>C = 검증 비용</li>\\n<li>F = 검증 단위당 V(N)가 얻는 수익 (두 검증자의 F는 같다고 가정한다.)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>단, R, L &gt; F &gt; C &gt; 0 이다.</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>검증 기대 보수: R*X + F-C</li>\\n<li>비검증 기대 보수: -L*<em>X</em>(1 - Y) + (1 - X(1 - Y))F</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>검증 및 비검증 보수의 표현식이 상당히 복잡해졌지만, 새롭게 추가된 부분인 (1 - Y)가 의미하는 바가 무엇인지 파악하면 이를 보다 직관적으로 이해할 수 있다. 롤업의 특징은 본인이 검증하지 않아도 다른 누군가가 검증한다면 내 자산또한 안전하게 지켜질 수 있다는 것이었다. 즉, Y가 1 혹은 1에 가깝다는 의미는 상대 검증자가 S를 검증할 것이라는 의미이고, 이는 곧 본인이 직접 검증하지 않아도, 심지어 시퀀서가 항상 공격을 하여 X가 1이 되어도 자신의 모든 자산과 추가적인 경제적 이익은 지켜질 수 있다는 것을 의미한다.</p>\\n<p>그렇다면 과연 두 검증자중에 어떤 검증자가 검증을 하게 될 것인지, 둘 다 검증을 하게 될지, 또는 아무도 검증을 하지 않게 될지가 궁금해진다. 이를 보다 직관적으로 살펴보기 위해 아주 단순한 게임 이론적 접근 방식을 사용해보자.</p>\\n<p>두 검증자의 검증 및 비검증 전략 선택에 대한 기대 보수는 다음과 같은 보수행렬표로 나타낼 수 있다.</p>\\n<p><em>두 검증자가 모두 검증에 성공했을 때 얻는 보상 R은 동일한 비율로 나누어진다고 가정한다.</em></p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*330AE7KQBApXG1lVp4bNsg.png\"></figure><p>이 게임의 내쉬균형은 각 변수의 값에 따라 달라지게 된다. 예를 들어, 시퀀서의 공격 확률이 높아 기대 검증 보상이 매우 높은 경우 모두가 검증(V, V) 하는 것이 균형이 되고, 반대로 공격 확률이 매우 낮아 비검증시 기대 손실이 크지 않다면 모두가 검증을 하지 않는것(NV, NV)이 균형이 된다. 또한, 공격 확률이 매우 높지도 매우 낮지도 않은 경우 두 검증자 중 단 한 명만이 검증을 하는 것(V, NV) (NV, V)이 균형이 된다. 이를 수식으로 나타내면 다음과 같다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>(V, V): X &gt; 2C/R</li>\\n<li>(V, NV) (NV, V): 2C/R &gt; X &gt; C/(R+L+F)</li>\\n<li>(NV, NV): X &lt; C/(R+L+F)</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>구체적인 예시를 통해 각 케이스들을 모두 살펴보도록 하자. 이 예시에서 X를 제외한 나머지 변수들의 값은 아래와 같이 주어졌다고 가정한다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>R = 100</li>\\n<li>L = 100</li>\\n<li>F = 5</li>\\n<li>C = 1</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>이 때, 시퀀서의 공격확률 X가 2C/R = 0.02 보다 큰 값인 X = 0.05 라고 가정해보자.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mSDVNPYFxeMC3ZHN4yf-Ww.png\"></figure><p>이 경우, 두 검증자 모두 검증 전략이 우월 전략이므로, (V, V)가 균형이 된다. 이는 매우 바람직한 상황이지만, 어디까지나 시퀀서의 공격확률이 매우 높은 상황을 가정한 것이므로, 현실적으로 이런 상황은 쉽게 발생하지 않을 것이다.</p>\\n<p>다음으로, X가 2C/R = 0.02 보다 작고, C/(R+L+F) = 0.0049 보다 큰 값인 X = 0.005 라고 가정해보자.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Sg7eXy0IDq7CNF41ZoLamA.png\"></figure><p>이 게임은 흥미롭게도 두 검증자가 같은 전략을 선택하는 순간 각자의 이익을 극대화하지 못하게 되고, 서로 다른 전략적 선택을 하는 것이 균형이 된다.</p>\\n<p>예를 들어, 검증자2가 검증 전략을 선택하게 되면 검증자1은 비검증 전략을 택할 것이고, 반대로 검증자 1이 검증 전략을 선택한다면 검증자 2는 비검증 전략을 선택할 것이다. 이와 비슷한 논리로 검증자2가 비검증 전략을 선택한다면 검증자1은 검증 전략을 선택하는게 가장 합리적이고, 반대로 검증자1이 비검증 전략을 택한다면 검증자2는 검증 전략을 택하게 된다.</p>\\n<p>즉, 이 게임에서는 두가지 균형이 존재하는데, (NV, V) (V, NV)가 바로 그것이다. 그렇다면 이 게임에서 두가지 균형중 어떠한 균형이 실현되는가? 이는 공약과 신빙성과 같은 요소에 따라 결정되는데, 예를 들면 다음과 같다.</p>\\n<p>이 게임에서 검증자2가 검증하지 않는 전략을 택했다고 하자. 검증자2는 공공연하게 검증자1에게 “나는 검증에 필요한 요구사항을 갖춘 장비가 없으므로 앞으로 검증을 하지 않겠다”고 엄포한 상황이다. 하지만 검증자1은 현재 검증을 할 수 있는 여건이 모두 마련된 상황이다. 이 때, 검증자1이 택할 수 있는 가장 합리적인 선택은 비검증 전략을 선택해 손해를 보는것보다, 소액의 검증 비용을 지불하더라도 상대적으로 더 높은 기대 보수를 얻을 수 있는 검증 전략일 것이다.</p>\\n<p>즉, 우리는 X가 충분히 높지도, 낮지도 않은 어떠한 지점에서는 두 검증자 중 단 한명의 검증자만이 검증 전략을 선택할 것임을 알 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>마지막으로, 시퀀서의 공격확률 X가 C/(R+L+F) = 0.0049 보다 작은 값인 X = 0.0001 라고 가정해보자.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WTDZVoQU_PmGWsqag6PS2w.png\"></figure><p>이 게임에서는 두 검증자 모두 비검증 전략이 우월전략이기 때문에, (NV, NV)가 균형이 된다. 계속해서 강조하듯이 롤업의 시퀀서는 사전에 각 변수들에 대한 정보를 미리 알 수 있기 때문에 효과적인 공격 확률을 계산할 수 있다. 따라서 시퀀서는 검증자들이 단 한명이라도 검증 전략을 선택하지 않을 수준의 확률로 공격을 할 것이다. 즉, 만약에 시퀀서가 공격을 한다면 C/(R+L+F)보다 낮은 확률로 공격을 할 것이다.</p>\\n<p>정리하면, 검증자의 수를 2명으로 늘린 모델에서도 시퀀서의 공격확률에 따라 각 검증자는 검증 또는 비검증 전략을 선택하게 되고, 공격확률이 낮아질수록 검증 전략을 선택하는 검증자의 수가 줄어든다는 것을 알 수 있다. 이는 검증자의 수를 N명으로 늘려도 크게 달라지지 않는다. 검증자의 수가 늘어날수록 기대 검증 보상의 양은 줄어들 것이고, 공격 확률이 아주 낮지 않은 경우에도 다른 한명의 검증자만 검증해도 자신의 이익을 지킬 수 있기 때문에 계속해서 검증 전략을 선택하는 검증자의 수는 줄어들 것이다. 또한 공격 확률이 매우 낮은 경우에는 단 한명의 검증자도 검증 전략을 선택하지 않게 된다.</p>\\n<p>이는 매우 충격적인 결과인데, <strong>검증자의 수와 관계 없이 롤업이 장기적으로 안전하게 운영 될수록 활성화된 검증자의 수는 계속해서 줄어들어 0에 수렴</strong>할 것이라는 사실이다.</p>\\n<h3>There is No Verifier’s Dilemma in Optimistic Rollup?</h3>\\n<p>앞서 논의한바와 같이 롤업이 검증자의 딜레마로 인해 안전성 측면에서 여러 문제점이 있음에도 불구하고, <strong>롤업에서 검증자의 딜레마는 사소한 이슈이며 이를 해결하기 위한 별도의 장치를 둘 필요가 없다는 주장도 존재한다.</strong> 결론부터 말하자면, 이러한 주장 중 일부는 타당하고, 일부는 그렇지 않다.</p>\\n<p>대체로 롤업에서 검증자의 딜레마를 고려할 필요가 없다는 주장의 근거는 크게 네가지로 요약된다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>토큰 소유자(Token Holder)</li>\\n<li>댑 운영자(Dapp Builder) — 롤업에서 트랜잭션이 발생함에 따라 일정한 수익(예: 이자 농사(Yield Farming))을 거두는 모든 참가자로 치환해도 무방하다.</li>\\n<li>이타적 검증자(Altruist)</li>\\n<li>빠른 출금(Fast Withdrawal)</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>각 근거가 정말로 검증자의 딜레마를 해결할 수 있는지 혹은 그렇지 않은지 차례대로 살펴보도록 하자.</p>\\n<h3>Token Holder</h3>\\n<p>롤업에서 검증자의 딜레마를 고려할 필요가 없다는 주장의 근거로 가장 먼저 등장하는 내용은 바로 레이어 2에 많은 토큰(혹은 자산)을 보유한 사용자의 경우 검증을 할 유인이 높을 것이라는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>하지만, 많은 토큰을 보유한 사용자는 근본적으로 앞서 논의한 모델에서 L이 상대적으로 높은 검증자에 지나지 않는다. 따라서 이는 시퀀서의 공격확률을 소폭 낮추는것 외에는 어떠한 의미도 없다.</p>\\n<p>여기서 다시 한번 유의해야 할 점은 단순히 검증자가 롤업에 예치한 자산에 해당하는 L을 늘리거나 시퀀서의 보증금인 R을 늘리는것은 검증자의 딜레마를 해결하는데 큰 도움이 되지 않는다는 것이다.</p>\\n<h3>Dapp Builder</h3>\\n<p>또 다른 근거는 바로 롤업에서 댑을 운영하는 경우, 댑의 운영자는 롤업이 안전하게 운영되어야만 지속적인 수익을 보장받을 수 있으므로 검증에 대한 유인이 클 것이라는 것이다. 하지만 이 또한 앞에서 충분히 논의한 내용이다. 검증단위당 얻는 수익 F가 크더라도, 이는 비검증시에도 시퀀서의 공격만 없다면 보장되는 수익이기 때문에 역시 시퀀서의 공격확률에 따라 검증 또는 비검증 전략을 선택하게 된다. 즉, 큰 규모의 댑을 운영하여 해당 댑의 운영자가 막대한 수익을 거두더라도 이것이 해당 댑의 운영자가 롤업을 항상 검증할 것이라는 보장으로 이어지지는 않는다.</p>\\n<h3>Altruist</h3>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/589/1*yb9EErnaKu8g8v5TNJP_tQ.png\"><figcaption>source: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1353695113860370436\">twitter</a></figcaption></figure><p>다음 근거는 바로 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism\">이타주의</a>이다. 이 세상의 모든 사람들은 항상 합리적이고 자신의 이익만을 극대화하는 선택만을 하지는 않는다. 만약 그렇다면, 수 많은 조건 없는 기부와 봉사 등의 행동은 설명되지 않는다.

자세히 알아보자.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>앨리스는 이반에게 0.1ETH의 수수료를 지불하고 L2에서 L1으로 10ETH를 출금하고자 한다.</li>\\n<li>앨리스는 빠른 출금 마켓 컨트랙트에 10ETH를 송금한다.</li>\\n<li>이반은 출금 요청을 확인 및 검증하고 L1에서 앨리스에게 수수료를 제외한 금액 9.9ETH를 송금한다.</li>\\n<li>출금에 필요한 DTD가 지난 후에 이반은 L2의 컨트랙트에 보관된 10ETH를 취득한다.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>여기서 중요한점은 이반은 앨리스의 빠른 출금을 처리하는 과정에서 앨리스의 출금이 올바른 요청인지 아닌지를 검증하게 된다는 것이다. 이는 곧 롤업의 상태가 올바르게 구성되었는지 검증하는 것을 의미한다. 검증자의 딜레마에서 문제가 되는 지점은 검증자의 검증 보상이 시퀀서의 공격 행위가 발생할 확률에 의존한다는 점이었다. <strong>하지만 빠른 출금의 사례에서 이반은 시퀀서의 공격 행위와 무관하게 검증을 할 유인이 있는 것처럼 보인다!</strong></p>\\n<p>이를 바탕으로 Super-Simple Model에서와 같이 이반의 검증 및 비검증 기대보수를 정의해보자.</p>\\n<p>이반이 빠른 출금을 처리하여 받는 수수료가 F라고 할 때, 검증작업에 대한 이반의 기대보수는 다음과 같다. 이 때, 이미 롤업에는 이반 이외의 N명의 검증자가 있다고 가정한다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>검증 기대 보수: R*X + F - C</li>\\n<li>비검증 기대 보수: -L*X + (1-X)F</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>여기서 재밌는 것은 롤업의 다른 검증자들과 달리 이반은 다른 검증자들의 검증 여부가 자신의 검증 및 비검증 보수에 어떠한 영향도 끼치지 않는다는 것이다. 그 이유는 빠른 출금이 갖는 특수한 성질 때문인데, 이반은 앨리스에게서 출금 요청을 받은 후 가능한 빠른 시간 내에 L1에서 자신의 토큰을 송금하게 된다. <strong>하지만 만약 앨리스의 출금 요청이 실제로는 잘못된 요청이었다는 사실이 DTD내에 다른 검증자에 의해 밝혀지더라도 이반은 자신의 토큰을 돌려받을 수 없게 된다.</strong> 이미 L1의 토큰은 엘리스에게 전송되었기 때문이다. 즉, 이반이 빠른 출금을 안전하게 처리하기 위해서는 다른 검증자에 의존하는 것이 아닌 이반 스스로 검증 작업을 수행해야 한다는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>이는 상당히 흥미로운 사실인데, 만약 롤업에 단 두명의 검증자만이 존재하고 한명은 이반과 같은 빠른 출금의 중개인이고 다른 한명은 평범한 검증자(e.g 토큰 보유자, 댑 운영자 등)라면, 이반은 일반적인 검증자에 비해 검증 전략을 선택할 가능성이 더 높다. 다음 보수행렬표를 통해 이를 자세히 살펴보자.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VqcSS67HSirXtHbA05J3mw.png\"></figure><p>앞서 언급했듯, 상대 검증자가 검증 전략을 선택하더라도 이반은 빠른 출금을 이용한 시퀀서의 공격 행위를 효과적으로 방어하기 어렵다. 따라서 이반이 비검증 전략을 선택하는 경우의 기대보수는 모두 동일하게 -L*X+(1-F)X 이다. 이것이 시사하는 바는 이반과 검증자 두 참가자 중 누군가 한명은 반드시 검증 전략을 선택해야 하는 상황(두명의 일반적인 검증자가 존재하는 모델에서 시퀀서의 공격확률이 매우 높지도, 낮지도 않은 상황과 유사하다)에서 이반이 상대적으로 검증 전략을 선택할 유인이 더 높다는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>보다 구체적으로, 2C/R &gt; X &gt; C/(R/2+L+F) 인 경우에 균형은 (V, NV)가 된다. <em>앞서 두 검증자만을 다룬 모델에서는 동일한 조건하에 균형이 (V, NV) (NV, V) 였다.</em> 즉, 공격 확률이 높지도 낮지도 않은 상황에서 이반은 항상 검증 전략을, 상대 검증자는 항상 비검증 전략을 선택하게 될 것임을 의미한다. 이를 구체적인 예시를 통해 살펴보자.</p>\\n<p>다음과 같은 조건하에 이반과 검증자의 보수행렬표는 다음과 같이 구성된다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>R = 100</li>\\n<li>L = 100</li>\\n<li>F = 5</li>\\n<li>C = 1</li>\\n<li>X

출금의 중개인이므로 검증 전략이 우월 전략이 된다. 따라서, 상대 검증자는 항상 비검증 전략을 선택할 것이다. 따라서 (V, NV)가 균형이 된다.</p>\\n<p>정리하면, <strong>동일한 조건 하에서 빠른 출금의 중개인은 일반적인 검증자에 비해 검증 유인이 더 크다고 볼 수 있다.</strong> 즉, 누군가 검증을 하게 된다면 이는 빠른 출금의 중개인일 가능성이 매우 높다는 것이다. 하지만, 이 사실이 이반이 항상 검증 전략을 선택할 것임을 증명하는 것은 아니다.</p>\\n<p>다시 한번 강조하자면, 이반이 검증 전략을 선택하는 것에 대한 유인이 상대적으로 큰 것은 사실이지만, 실질적으로 이러한 전략적 선택을 할 때는 시퀀서의 공격 확률이 고려된다. 따라서 이제 우리가 중점적으로 보아야 하는 것은 빠른 출금의 중개인은 정확히 어떠한 기준으로 이러한 전략적 선택을 하게 되고, 이 중개인이 가능한 검증 전략을 선택하게 하려면 어떠한 요인이 필요한가를 알아보는 것이다. 이를 다음 장에서 구체적으로 알아보도록 하자.</p>\\n<h3>Fast Withdrawal and Auditing Incentives</h3>\\n<p>이 장에서는 빠른 출금의 중개인인 이반이 롤업에 대한 검증 및 비검증 전략을 어떻게 선택하게 되는지, 그 변인은 무엇인지, 나아가 이반이 항상 롤업을 검증하게 하기 위해서는 어떠한 추가적인 장치가 필요한지 자세히 살펴본다.</p>\\n<h4>Attack-Verify Game</h4>\\n<p>빠른 출금의 중개인인 이반이 어떠한 기준으로 검증 및 비검증 전략을 선택하게 되는지를 알아보기 위해 이반과 시퀀서의 단순한 Attack-Verify Game을 다음과 같이 구성해보자.</p>\\n<p>이 단순한 게임의 경기자는 이반과 시퀀서 단 두명이다. 시퀀서는 이반에게 빠른 출금을 요청하게 되며, 이 때 위조된 토큰을 이용하여 빠른 출금을 요청할지 또는 올바른 토큰을 이용하여 빠른 출금을 요청할지 선택할 수 있다. 이를 공격과 비공격 전략이라고 부르겠다.</p>\\n<p>반대로 이반은 시퀀서의 빠른 출금 요청을 받으면 이를 검증하고 처리할 것인지 또는 검증을 하지 않고 처리할 것인지 선택할 수 있다. 이를 검증과 비검증 전략이라고 하겠다.</p>\\n<p>이 게임에서 이반과 시퀀서는 서로의 전략적 선택에 따라 얻을 수 있는 기대보수가 달라지게 되는데, 이는 구체적으로 다음과 같은 보수행렬표로 나타낼 수 있다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>R: 시퀀서 S의 보증금 / 검증 성공시 이반에게 주어지는 보상</li>\\n<li>L: 빠른 출금 금액 / 시퀀서의 공격 성공시 이반이 잃는 금액</li>\\n<li>F: 빠른 출금 수수료</li>\\n<li>C: 검증 비용</li>\\n</ul>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\"

(NV,NA)기대보수는 모두 같을 것이고, (V,A),(NV,A)의 기대보수와 비교했을 때 유의미한 차이를 기대하기는 어렵다.</em></p>\\n<p>이 때, R,L &gt; F &gt; C 라는 가정하에 이 게임에서 순수전략 내쉬균형은 존재하지 않는다. 예시를 통해 이를 구체적으로 살펴보자.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>R = 100</li>\\n<li>L = 100</li>\\n<li>F = 5</li>\\n<li>C = 1</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>이 값을 위에서 구성한 보수행렬표에 대입하면 다음과 같다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6QA6Ud-4369o5BfBRlfHTw.png\"></figure><p>이 게임에서 이반과 시퀀서 모두에게 우월전략과 열등전략은 존재하지 않는다. 또한 순수전략 내쉬균형도 존재하지 않는다. 이는 서로의 전략적 선택에 따라 각자의 전략적 선택이 완전히 달라지기 때문이다. 만약 시퀀서가 공격을 하지 않는다면 이반은 검증을 하지 않는 것이 유리하고, 이반이 검증을 하지 않는다면 시퀀서는 공격을 하는 것이 유리하다. 반대로 시퀀서가 공격을 한다면 이반은 검증을 하는 것이 유리하고, 이반이 검증을 한다면 시퀀서는 공격을 하지 않는 것이 유리하다.</p>\\n<p>이처럼 이반과 시퀀서의 게임에서 단 하나의 전략 벡터를 선택하는 순수전략 균형은 존재하지 않는다. 이는 다시 말해, 이반과 시퀀서 모두 상황에 따라 단 하나의 전략이 아닌 두가지 전략 모두를 사용하게 될 것임을 의미한다.</p>\\n<h3>Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium</h3>\\n<p>그렇다면 이반 또는 시퀀서는 두가지 전략을 어떠한 기준으로 선택하게 될까? 이를 알아보기 위해 우리는 혼합전략 내쉬균형이 무엇인지 살펴볼 필요가 있다.</p>\\n<p><em>혼합전략을 사용할 때 각 경기자의 최적전략은 상대방이 어떠한 선택을 하더라도 기대보수가 같아지게끔하는 것이다. 즉, 상대방이 어떠한 전략을 취하더라도 기대보수가 무차별해지는 지점을 찾는 것이다.</em></p>\\n<p><strong>이반이 검증전략을 선택할 확률을 P</strong>라고 하고, <strong>시퀀서가 공격전략을 선택할 확률을 Q</strong>라고 한다면, 혼합전략 내쉬균형에 따른 각 확률 P, Q는 다음과 같다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>-R*P + L(1-P) = 0*P + 0*(1-P)</li>\\n<li><strong>P = L/(R+L)</strong></li>\\n<li>(R+F-C)Q + (F-C)(1-Q) = -L*Q + F(1-Q)</li>\\n<li><strong>Q = C/(R+L+F)</strong></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>이에 앞의 예시에서 사용한 변수값을 할당하면, 혼합전략 내쉬균형은 다음과 같이 계산된다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>P = 1/2</li>\\n<li>Q = 1/205</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>즉, 이반은 검증전략과 비검증전략을 각각 2번에 1번꼴로 선택한다. 반대로 시퀀서의 경우 205번에 1번꼴로 공격전략을 205번에 204번꼴로 비공격 전략을 선택하게 된다. 하지만 우리가 원하는 것은 이반이 오직 2번에 1번꼴로 검증전략을 선택하는 것이 아니라 이를 최대한 1에 가깝게 만드는 것이다. 또한 시퀀서의 공격확률을 1/205에서 0에 가깝게 줄이는 것이다. 이 두가지 목적을 모두 달성하기 위해서 우리는 어떠한 조치를 취해야 할까?</p>\\n<p><strong>가장 효과적인 방법은 L을 늘리는 것이다.</strong> L을 높이는 것은 검증자의 검증 전략 선택 확률을 높임과 동시에 시퀀서의 공격 전략 선택 확률을 줄이는 역할을 한다. 반대로, R을 높이는 것은 공격 확률을 줄이는 역할을 할 수는 있지만, 검증 전략 선택 확률은 오히려 줄이는 역할을 한다. 요컨대, 만약 롤업에서 자본 제한을 높여 검증자의 딜레마를 해결하려 한다면 L을 높이는 것이 가장 유효한 방법이라는 것이다. 하지만, 아쉽게도 이러한 자본제한을 높이는 방법은 명백히 한계가 존재한다. 따라서 우리는 이 문제를 해결하기 위해 다른 접근 방법이 필요하다.</p>\\n<h3>Maximin Strategy</h3>\\n<p>우리는 혼합전략 내쉬균형을 통해 이반과 시퀀서가 일정 확률에 따라 검증과 공격에 대한 전략적 결정을 내리게 된다는 것을 알아보았다. 하지만 과연 현실세계에서 이반과 시퀀서는 정확히 이 균형에 부합하는 확률로 각 전략을 선택하게 될것인가에 대해 의문이 생긴다. 두 경기자 모두 이익을 극대화하는 전략을 선택했을 때 추가적으로 얻는 기대 이익은 비교적 낮은 반면에 그 과정에서 잘못된 전략적 선택을 했을 때 발생하는 손실은 그야말로 재앙에 가깝기 때문이다.</p>\\n<p>예를 들어, 이반은 비검증전략을 선택할 경우 시퀀서가 공격을 하지 않는다면 단 1만큼의 추가 보수를 얻는 반면에, 시퀀서가 공격 전략을 선택했을 경우 -100이라는 큰 손실을 보게 된다. 시퀀서 또한 비공격시 얻는 것도 잃는 것도 없지만, 공격을 선택하고 실패했을 경우의 기대손실이 상대적으로 매우 크다.</p>\\n<p><strong>이러한 경우 일반적으로 경기자는 이익의 극대화보다는 안전성을 추구하는 경향이 있다. 이 때 경기자가 선택할 수 있는 전략이 바로 최소극대화 전략이다.</strong></p>\\n<p><em>이는 비단 이반의 검증 및 비검증 전략 선택에만 해당되는 이야기는 아니다. 예를 들어, 암호화폐를 거래하고 보유하는 사용자들은 리스크를 대하는 성향에 따라 암호화폐를 보관하는 방법에 있어 다양한 전략적 선택을 하게 된다. 암호화폐를 보유하고 거래할 때 일반적으로 가장 편리한 방법은 중앙화된 거래소에 보관하는 것이다. 하지만 이러한 방법은 거래소에 문제가 발생했을 경우 자신이 보유한 암호화폐를 잠재적으로 모두 잃어버릴 위험이 있다. 때문에 위험 회피 성향이 낮은 사용자들은 거래소에 암호화폐를 보관하고 거래하지만, 위험 회피 성향이 다소 높은 사용자들은 거래소에 암호화폐를 보관하지 않고 메타마스크와 같은 지갑 서비스를 이용하거나 혹은 하드웨어 월렛을 사용하게 된다. 이에 더해 위험 회피 성향이 극도로 높은 사용자는 암호화폐 자체에 문제가 생길 수 있으므로 동시에 풀 노드 혹은 아카이브 노드를 운영하게 된다. 이들 모두 암호화폐를 거래소에 보관했을 때 얻는 기대보수는 동일하지만, 위험 회피 성향의 정도, 즉 전략적 안전성을 얼마나 중요시 하느냐에 따라 전략적 선택이 달라지는 것이다.</em></p>\\n<p>최소극대화 전략은 경기자가 선택할 수 있는 전략이 각각 최악의 결과를 가져온다고 가정하고, 그 중에 그나마 큰 보수를 택하는 전략을 의미한다. 즉, 다른 경기자가 어떠한 결정을 하더라도 최소한으로 보장받을 수 있는 보수를 극대화하는 것이다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OHUKVdlmeSvzSy2Vj4Imag.png\"></figure><p>앞서 예시로 든 보수행렬표에서 이반과 시퀀서가 내쉬균형이 아닌 최소극대화 전략을 따른다고 가정해보자.</p>\\n<p>이 때, 이반의 최소극대전략은 V가 되고 시퀀서의 최소극대전략은 NA가 된다. 따라서 두 경기자의 최소극대 보수벡터는 (4,0) 이 된다. 다시 말해, 이반과 시퀀서는 최소극대화 전략을 선택할 경우 각각 항상 검증 전략과 비공격 전략을 선택하게 됨을 의미한다.</p>\\n<p><strong>따라서 우리는 이반과 시퀀서, 혹은 이반만이 전략적 안전성을 최우선으로 두고 있다는 가정하에 빠른 출금이 발생할 때마다 항상 해당 롤업은 검증될 것이라는 결론에 도달할 수 있다.</strong></p>\\n<p>하지만 모든 경기자가 전략적 안정성(stability)보다 안전성(security)을 우선한다고 가정하는것은 무리가 있다. 경기자의 성향은 각 개인마다 다를 것이기 때문이다. <strong>따라서 최소극대화 전략을 통한 접근은 검증자의 딜레마를 기존보다 다소 완화할 수는 있겠지만 이를 완전히 해결했다고 볼 수 없다.</strong></p>\\n<h3>Fast Withdrawal With Attention Challenge</h3>\\n<p>앞서 우리는 각 경기자가 전략적 안전성을 우선 가치로 둔다는 가정하에 검증자의 딜레마가 해결될 수 있다는 점을 살펴보았다. 하지만 이는 여전히 경기자의 성향에 대한 가정을 요구하므로, 검증자의 딜레마를 다소 완화했을 뿐 완전히 해결한것은 아니라는 점 또한 논의하였다.</p>\\n<p>만약 이러한 가정도 요구하지 않고 검증자의 딜레마를 해결하려면 어떠한 추가적인 장치가 필요할까? 빠른 출금의 사례에서 이반이 반드시 검증전략을 선택하지 않는 이유는 매우 단순하다. 검증전략이 우월전략이 아니기 때문이다.</p>\\n<p>반대로 생각해서 검증전략을 우월전략으로 만들기 위해서는 어떻게 해야할까? 이 또한 매우 단순하다. 비검증-비공격 전략에 대한 이반의 보수를 검증-비공격 전략의 보수보다 작거나 같도록 만드는 것이다. 우리는 빠른 출금에 주의 챌린지(Attention Challenge)를 도입하는 것으로 이러한 목적을 달성할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p><em>주의 챌린지는 Ed Felten의 글 </em><a

모든 경우에서 기대 보수가 더 높으므로, 검증 전략이 우월전략이 된다. 시퀀서는 이반이 항상 검증 전략을 선택할 것이기 때문에 반드시 비공격 전략을 선택하게 된다. 따라서 <strong>(V, NA) 전략벡터가 순수전략 내쉬균형</strong>이 되며, <strong>이는 곧 롤업의 안전성이 항상 지켜질 수 있음을 의미한다!</strong></p>\\n<p><em>주의 챌린지를 일반적인 검증자에게 도입하게 되면, 이 경우 또한 검증 전략이 항상 우월전략이 될 수 있도록 유도할 수 있다. 하지만 주의 챌린지의 특성상 L1과의 상호작용을 요구하기 때문에 주의 챌린지의 대상과 확률을 확대하는 것은 시스템 차원에서 큰 부담이 될 수 있다. 이에 대한 자세한 내용은 </em><strong><em>Trade-Off of Attention Challenge</em></strong><em>에서 자세히 다룬다.</em></p>\\n<h3>Cross-Rollup Transaction</h3>\\n<p>앞서 우리는 빠른 출금의 중개인이 전략적 안정성이 아닌 안전성을 택할 경우나, 혹은 주의 챌린지를 도입했을 경우 반드시 롤업을 검증하는 전략을 선택할 것임을 확인하였다. 재밌는 점은 롤업에서 빠른 출금의 중개인과 완전히 동일한 보수 구조를 갖는 또 다른 참가자가 존재한다는 것이다. 이는 바로 크로스 롤업 트랜잭션(Cross-Rollup Transaction)의 중개인(이하 롤업 중개인)이다.</p>\\n<p><em>이 글에서 다루는 크로스 롤업 트랜잭션은 다음 두 글에서 다룬

방식으로 롤업과 롤업간의 빠른 토큰 전송 서비스를 제공할 수 있다. 예를 들어, 서로 다른 롤업 A와 B가 있고, 앨리스가 롤업 중개인 이반을 통해 토큰을 A에서 B로 전송하려고 할 때 다음과 같은 방식으로 이를 진행할 수 있다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>앨리스는 이반에게 0.1 ETH의 수수료를 지불하고 롤업 A에서 B로 10 ETH를

ETH를 취득한다.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>이를 통해 알 수 있는 것은 출금과 송금의 목적지만 L1에서 롤업 B로 달라졌을 뿐 다른 요소는 전혀 변경되지 않았다는 것이다. 이는 롤업 중개인 이반도 빠른 출금의 중개인 이반과 동일한 검증 및 비검증 기대보수를 갖는다는 것을 의미한다.</p>\\n<p>따라서 크로스 롤업 중개인 이반과 시퀀서의 보수

되므로, 이는 롤업의 안전성을 극대화하는 아주 좋은 전략이 될 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>하지만, 이는 두가지 측면에서 맹점이 존재한다.</p>\\n<p>첫째, 주의 챌린지에 응답하는 행위는 <strong>온체인(on-chain) 트랜잭션</strong>을 수반하므로, 주의 챌린지의 대상이 늘어난다는 것은 필요한 온체인 트랜잭션의 수가 많아진다는 것을 의미한다.</p>\\n<p>둘째, 롤업의 모든 사용자가 주의 챌린지의 대상이 된다면, 이는 롤업의 <strong>사용자 경험</strong>을 심각하게 저해할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>첫번째 이슈부터 자세히 논의해보자. 주의 챌린지의 대상이 늘어난다는 것은 필연적으로 주의 챌린지에 응답하는 대상의 수가 늘어나는 것을 의미한다. 물론 대상이 되는 검증자의 수(N)가 많아질수록 주의 챌린지의 대상으로 선정될 확률 P를 줄이면, 주의 챌린지에 대한 응답 횟수를 적절히 조절할 수 있으므로 문제가 없다고 할 수 있다. 하지만 P를 지나치게 줄이게 될 경우 주의 챌린지에 제대로 응답을 하지 못했을 경우 발생할 수 있는 기대 손실(-P*A)이 낮아지게 되고, 이는 곧 주의 챌린지가 검증전략이 항상 우월전략이 되도록 유도할 수 없게 될 수 있음을 의미한다. 물론 이 경우에도 A를 높여 이를 상쇄할 수 있겠지만, 이는 곧 자본제한을 높이는 것을 의미하기 때문에 바람직한 해결책이라고 보기는 힘들다. 요컨대, 검증자의 수를 늘리는 것은 주의 챌린지로 인해 더 많은 양의 온체인 트랜잭션이 발생할 수 있음을 의미한다.</p>\\n<p>두번째 이슈는 주의 챌린지의 대상을 무분별하게 확대할 경우 롤업의 사용자 경험을 저해할 수 있다는 것이다. 롤업의 장점은 모든 사용자가 검증자가 되지 않아도, 즉 최소한 한명의 정직한 검증자만 있어도 안전하게 동작할 수 있다는 것에 있다. 물론, 롤업의 정직한 검증자는 다다익선 이지만, 이것이 모든 사용자가 검증자가 되어야 한다는 것을 의미하는 것은 아니다. <strong>극단적으로 표현하면 롤업을 아무도 검증하지 않게 만드는 것만큼 바람직하지 않은 것이 모두가 롤업을 검증하게 만드는 것이다.</strong> 이는 이미 이더리움 커뮤니티에서 플라즈마의 단점을 논의할 때 충분히 논의된 것이므로 더 이상의 자세한 설명은 생략하겠다.</p>\\n<p>요컨대, 우리는 주의 챌린지를 무분별하게 적용해서는 안된다. <strong>가장 바람직한 것은 각 롤업이 달성하고자 하는 안전성 수준에 맞추어 적절한 대상에게 주의 챌린지를 현명하게 적용하는 것이다.</strong> 만약 빠른 출금과 크로스 롤업 트랜잭션이 활발하게 발생하고 있다면, 주의 챌린지를 굳이 적용하지 않아도 될 수 있다. (전략적 안전성을 택하는 중개인의 비율이 충분하다고 가정한다면 말이다.) 반대로, 롤업이 배포된 초기에는 빠른 출금이나 크로스 롤업 트랜잭션이 활발하게 발생하지 않을 수 있고, 활성화된 검증자의 수가 매우 적을 수 있다. 이러한 경우에는 주의 챌린지를 적극적으로 도입하는 것이 롤업의 안전성을 지키는데 큰 도움이 될 수 있다.</p>\\n<h3>Additional Reward to Attention Challenge</h3>\\n<p>주의 챌린지는 안전성을 극대화하는데 아주 효과적인 방법이지만, 검증자에게 일종의 부정 피드백(Negative Feedback)인 처벌로 검증을 유도한다. 이 때, 검증자는 주의 챌린지로 인해 검증 전략을 선택하게 되지만, 이러한 검증을 통해 추가적으로 얻는 보상은 없고 오직 비용만 추가적으로 발생할 뿐이다. 따라서 모든 검증자들은 주의 챌린지의 도입에 대해 긍정적인 관점으로 바라볼 수 없게 된다.</p>\\n<p>하지만, 주의 챌린지의 대상이 되는 검증자들에게 추가적인 보상을 지급할 수 있다면, 개별 검증자가 주의 챌린지로 인해 발생하는 경제적 비용을 완화하거나 이를 상회할 수 있을 것이다. 예를 들어, 특정 롤업에서 자체적으로 발행되는 토큰이 있고, 이 토큰의 일부가 주의 챌린지에 참여하는 검증자에게 보상으로 주어진다고 하자. 이 때, 이 보상의 양이 주의 챌린지의 응답비용보다 높다면 모든 검증자들은 주의 챌린지에 대해 어떠한 부담도 느끼지 않을 것이다.</p>\\n<p><em>사용자에게 추가적인 수수료를 징수하여 검증자에게 지급하는 것도 하나의 방법일 수 있다. 하지만 이 경우 사용자에게 추가적인 비용을 부과하는 것이 큰 부담이 되지 않도록 신중하게 비용의 수준을 조정해야 할 것이다.</em></p>\\n<h3>Repeated Game</h3>\\n<p>지금까지 다루었던 이반과 시퀀서의 검증게임은 모두 일회게임(one-shot game)이었다. 하지만 현실세계의 많은 경제활동은 동일한 주체들간의 반복적 상호작용으로 일어난다. 이와 마찬가지로 롤업 세상에서 일어나는 검증게임 또한 단 1회로 끝나는 것이 아니다. 이반과 시퀀서는 여러번에 걸쳐 진행되는 반복게임(repeated game)을 진행하게 될 것이다. 이들은 반복게임의 각 단계(stage)별로 이전에 각자가 행동했던 결과의 기록(history)에 따라 현재 단계에 대한 전략적 선택을 하게 될 것이다. 우리는 이러한 측면에서 이반과 시퀀서의 검증게임을 단순히 일회게임이 아닌 반복게임의 관점에서 분석해 볼 필요가 있다.</p>\\n<p>먼저 반복게임이 무한하게 진행되는 무한반복게임에서는 일회게임의 균형과는 다르거나 또는 더 많은 균형이 존재할 수 있다는 사실은 잘 알려져있다. 이는 바로 무한반복게임에서는 일회게임이나 유한반복게임과 달리 협조체제가 달성될 수 있기 때문인데, 현재 상대방을 속여 당장의 이득을 취하더라도 상대방의 보복에 따른 미래의 손실이 크다면 지금 유지되고 있는 협조관계를 깨지 않는 것이 유리하기 때문이다.</p>\\n<p>반대로 동일한 반복게임에 포함되지만, 반복횟수가 유한한 유한반복게임은 이야기가 전혀 다르다. 유한반복게임에서는 무한반복게임과 달리 반복횟수가 아무리 많아지더라도 협조체제 달성이 불가능하기 때문에, 유일한 내쉬균형을 갖는 일회게임은 아무리 많은 게임이 반복되더라도 경기자들은 매 단계마다 일회게임의 내쉬균형을 선택하게 된다.</p>\\n<p>여기서 우리가 주목해야할 점은 이반과 시퀀서의 검증게임을 어떠한 범주에서 바라보아야 하는가이다. 반복횟수가 무한할것인지 혹은 유한할것인지에 대해 논의하기 전에 앞서 한가지 질문에 대해 생각해보자.</p>\\n<p>만약 롤업 체인을 운영하는 시퀀서가 고의여부와 관계없이 트랜잭션을 올바르게 처리하지 않았다면 시퀀서와 이반(이반을 다수의 검증자들로 치환해도 좋다)은 어떻게 되는가?</p>\\n<p>먼저, 시퀀서의 부정행위가 DTD(Dispute Time Delay)내에 검증되었다고 가정해보자. 이 때 시퀀서는 자신의 보증금의 전부 혹은 일부를 몰수당할것이고, 일체의 시퀀서 권한을 박탈당할 것이다. 반대로 이반은 시퀀서의 보증금의 일부를 보상으로 받게 된다. 그리고 이후의 검증게임은 어떻게 되는가? 종료된다!</p>\\n<p>이번에는 시퀀서의 부정행위가 DTD이후에 ‘발견’되었다고 가정해보자. 이미 시퀀서에게 속고 빠른 출금을 제공해준 이반은 DTD가 지나서 시퀀서가 자신에게 준 토큰을 확인하지만 이내 그것이 올바르지 않은 값임을 발견할 것이다. 이 때, 시퀀서와 이반에게는 어떤 일들이 일어나는가? 먼저 이반은 이미 레이어 1에서 자신의 토큰을 빼앗긴 후이고, 이는 DTD이내에 검증되지 않았으므로 어떠한 보상도 받을 수 없게 된다. 반대로 시퀀서는 어떻게 되는가? 각 롤업의 사전에 정해진 규칙에 따라 상이할 수 있지만, 비록 DTD이내에 검증이 되지 않아 보증금을 몰수하지 못하고 기존의 상태값 또한 변경이 불가능 해도, 적어도 사후에 시퀀서의 역할 자체는 정지될 것이다. 즉, 이 경우에도 역시 이후의 검증게임은 종료되는 것이다.</p>\\n<p><em>여러분은 점원이 횡령을 했다는 것을 오랜 시간이 지난 후에 발견했다면, 이후의 가게 운영을 계속해서 맡기겠는가? 여러분이 천사가 아니라면 당연히 점원을 해고할 것이다. 이미 오랜 시간이 흘러 도둑질에 대한 금전적 책임은 물을 수 없더라도 말이다.</em></p>\\n<p>여기서 우리는 시퀀서가 공격을 하는 순간 검증자의 검증 여부와 관계없이 반복되는 검증게임은 종료된다는 것을 알 수 있다. 이를 통해 우리는 검증게임이 무한히 반복될 것이라고 가정하기보다 반복횟수는 사전에 정확히 알 수 없지만 유한한 횟수로 반복될 것이라고 가정하는 것이 보다 합리적이라는 것을 알 수 있다.</p>\\n<p><strong>따라서 이반과 시퀀서의 검증게임은 무한반복게임이 아닌 유한반복게임이라고 정의하는 것이 보다 합리적이고, 따라서 일회게임에서의 균형이 매 단계마다 반복될 것임을 알 수 있다.</strong></p>\\n<h3>Related Research</h3>\\n<p>앞서 검증자의 딜레마가 근래에 새롭게 제기된 문제가 아니라 이미 다양한 분야에서 제기되고 있는 문제중 하나라는 점을 지적했다. 때문에 이를 해결하려는 연구들 또한 이미 진행되어 왔다.</p>\\n<p>이 장에서는 다른 다양한 플랫폼에서 검증자의 딜레마를 해결하기 위해 제시한 솔루션들을 다룬다.</p>\\n<h3>Forced Error &amp; Jackpot — Truebit</h3>\\n<p>먼저 잭팟에 대해 자세히 설명하기 전에 <a href=\"https://truebit.io/\">트루빗(Truebit)</a>이 무엇인지 간단하게 알아보자. 트루빗은 일종의 오프체인 연산 솔루션으로, 이더리움의 낮은 블록 가스 리밋 제한으로 인해 실행이 불가능한 복잡도가 높은 트랜잭션을 오프체인에서 실행한 후 결과만을 온체인에 기록하는 방식으로 작동한다.</p>\\n<p>트루빗 프로토콜을 구성하는 구성원은 크게 3가지 타입으로 분류되며, 각 구성원이 수행하는 역할과 책임은 다음과 같다.</p>\\n<p>1. 의뢰인(Task Giver)</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>해결자에게 복잡한 트랜잭션에 대한 연산을 의뢰한다.</li>\\n<li>의뢰시 소정의 수수료를 해결자에게 지급한다.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>2. 해결자(Solver)</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>의뢰인의 작업을 오프체인에서 수행한다.</li>\\n<li>일정 금액의 보증금을 미리 예치한다.</li>\\n<li>작업을 올바르지 않게 수행했음이 증명되면 보증금을 몰수당한다.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>3. 검증자(Verifier)</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>해결자의 작업이 올바르게 수행되었는지 검증한다.</li>\\n<li>문제가 발견되었을 경우 일정 금액을 예치하고 검증게임(Verification Game)을 요청하여 해결자의 연산이 틀렸음을 증명한다.</li>\\n<li>검증게임에서 승리시 해결자의 보증금을 상금으로 받는다.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>여기서 단번에 파악할 수 있는 것은 트루빗 프로토콜이 안전하게 작동하기 위해서는 바로 검증자의 역할이 매우 중요하다는 것이다. 검증자가 해결자의 작업이 올바르게 수행되었는지 제대로 검증하지 않는다면 해결자가 오프체인에서 올바르게 연산한 결과만을 온체인에 제출했는지 확신할 수 없기 때문이다. 따라서 우리가 주목해야 할 것은 트루빗에서 검증자는 항상 검증을 수행할 용의가 있는가일 것이다.</p>\\n<p>눈치가 빠른 독자들은 트루빗 프로토콜의 검증자의 검증 및 비검증 효용은 앞서 논의한 Super-Simple Game의 그것과 비슷한 구조일 것이라 생각했을 것이다. 이는 실제로 그러하다. 트루빗의 검증 및 비검증 효용을 자세히 살펴보자.</p>\\n<p>만약 해결자가 올바르지 않은 연산 결과를 제출할 확률이 X라면, 검증자의 기대 보수는 다음과 같이 나타낼 수 있다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>검증 기대 보수: <em>R*</em>X-C</li>\\n<li>비검증 기대 보수: <em>0 (여기서 검증자는 해결자를 검증하는데 실패하더라도 어떠한 명시적 페널티도 없다)</em>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>이러한 모델에서 검증자의 검증에 대한 유인을 확실하게 보장하기 어렵다는것은 이제 너무나 자명한 사실이다. 물론, 트루빗 프로토콜의 설계자들 또한 이를 정확하게 인지하고 있었다. 이를 해결하기 위해 트루빗은 강제 오류(Forced Error)와 잭팟(Jackpot)을 도입하였다.</p>\\n<p>트루빗에서 검증자의 딜레마의 가장 큰 원인은 역시 검증자의 보상이 해결자의 공격 확률에 의존하기 때문이다. 이를 해결하는 것이 바로 강제 오류인데, 강제 오류는 해결자의 공격 여부와 관계없이 시스템에 의해 고의적으로 랜덤하게 발생되는 오류를 말한다. 즉, 해결자가 공격을 하지 않더라도 랜덤하게 강제 오류가 발생하므로, 검증자는 이를 검증하여 보상을 받을 수 있게 된다.</p>\\n<p>강제 오류에 대한 검증 보상은 해결자의 보증금을 이용할 수 없기 때문에 새롭게 보상금을 조달할 필요가 생긴다. 이것이 바로 잭팟이다. 의뢰인은 작업을 요청할 때마다 해결자에게 지급하는 수수료 외에 별도로 세금(Tax)를 지불하는데, 이 세금이 잭팟 보상금의 원천이 된다.</p>\\n<p>요컨대, 사용자에게서 소정의 수수료를 추가로 받아 보상풀을 형성하고, 이 보상금을 랜덤하게 발생한 강제 오류를 성공적으로 검증한 검증자에게 분배하는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>잭팟 보상은 정해진 기간 내에 강제 오류를 검증한 검증자 누구에게나 주어진다. 단, 수 많은 복제된 검증자 계정을 동원하여 잭팟 보상을 받는 시빌 공격(Sybil Attack)이 가능하므로, 트루빗은 보상의 분배를 강제 오류를 검증한 계정의 수에 비례하여 지수적으로 감소하도록 설계하였다. 정확한 잭팟 보상 분배 금액은 다음과 같이 계산된다.</p>\\n<ul><li>J/2^(k-1) (k = 강제 오류를 검증한 검증자 계정의 수)</li></ul>\\n<p>트루빗의 검증자는 잭팟으로 인한 기대보수가 검증비용보다 높다면 항상 검증을 할 유인이 있다고 볼 수 있다. 다시 말해, 강제 오류가 발생할 확률이 P라고 한다면, P*J/2^(k-1) &gt; C 일 때 트루빗의 검증자는 항상 검증을 할 유인이 있는 것이다. P와 J의 변수값은 해결자의 공격 확률과 달리 시스템적으로 통제 가능한 변수이므로, 검증자들로 하여금 항상 검증을 할 유인이 있도록 유도할 수 있을 것이다.</p>\\n<p>잭팟 모델은 이러한 장점이 있지만, 반대로 다음과 같은 이슈 또한 존재한다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>보상의 예측 불가능성</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>사용자에 추가적인 수수료 부과</strong></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>첫번째 이슈는 강제 오류의 발생 여부는 오직 확률적으로만 예측이 가능하다는 점이다. 운이 따른다면 단 한번의 검증만으로 보상을 받을수도 있고, 수백번의 검증후에도 보상을 받지 못할수도 있다. 기댓값은 예상이 가능하지만 잭팟은 일종의 복권과 같기 때문에 검증자의 꾸준한 참여를 이끌어내기에는 부적합한 측면이 있다. 이에 대한 자세한 내용은 <a href=\"https://www.deconlab.io/simulation-of-truebit-protocol-part-1/\">Decon에서 작성한 글</a>을 참고하라.</p>\\n<p>이와 더불어 강제 오류의 발생 여부는 구조상 특정 해결자가 가장 먼저 이 사실을 알게 된다. 이는 해당 해결자에게 강제 오류에 대한 배타적인 정보를 먼저 제공하므로, 해결자는 이를 활용하여 일체의 검증 행위 없이 잭팟 보상을 차지할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>둘째로, 잭팟 모델이 의도한대로 동작하기 위해서는 무엇보다 잭팟 보상금의 확보가 필수적이다. 잭팟 보상금이 충분히 크지 않다면 검증자에게 적절한 인센티브를 제공할 수 없게 된다. 하지만 잭팟 보상금은 작업 의뢰인이 모두 부담하게 되므로, 보상금의 크기를 늘리기 위해서는 필연적으로 의뢰인에게 추가적인 수수료가 부담되어야 한다는 것을 의미한다.</p>\\n<h4>Application to Rollup</h4>\\n<p>잭팟 모델은 여러 이슈가 존재하지만, 강제 오류와 잭팟 보상을 통해 검증자에게 검증 보상에 대한 기댓값을 검증 비용보다 높게 설정하여 검증 유인을 높일 수 있다는 측면에서 여전히 그 가치가 있다.</p>\\n<p>하지만 이를 롤업의 검증자의 딜레마를 해결하기 위해 활용하는것은 쉽지 않다. 그 이유는 첫째, 잭팟 보상금 기금 구성이 쉽지 않고, 둘째, 롤업은 강제 오류를 발생시키기에 적합한 구조는 아니라는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>먼저 잭팟 보상금 기금을 구성하기 위해서는 추가적인 재원이 필요한데, 이를 롤업의 사용자에게 추가적으로 부담하는것은 무리가 있다. 이에 대한 대안으로 해당 롤업의 생태계 차원에서 발행되는 별도의 토큰 보상을 지급할 수 있다. 하지만 모든 롤업이 이러한 토큰을 발행할 수는 없을 뿐더러, 잭팟 보상금이 해당 생태계에서 발행되는 토큰의 가치에 온전히 의존하기 때문에 안전성 측면에서 추가적인 위험이 발생할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>또한 롤업은 강제 오류를 발생시키기 매우 어려운 구조를 갖고 있다. 트루빗에서는 강제 오류를 위해 작업을 수행한 후 올바른 솔루션과 잘못된 솔루션을 모두 제출한다. 만약 강제 오류가 발생되어야 하는 상황이면 잘못된 솔루션을 지정한 후 강제 오류였음을 밝히게 되고, 반대의 경우 올바른 솔루션을 지정하게 된다. 트루빗은 각 의뢰인의 의뢰하는 작업들이 독립된 고유한 작업들이기 때문에 이러한 방식으로 강제오류를 유도하는 것이 크게 문제가 되지 않는다.</p>\\n<p>하지만 롤업에서 강제 오류를 발생시킨다면, 올바르지 않은 상태값을 기준으로 이후의 트랜잭션들을 처리해야 한다. 그렇지 않은 경우 누구나 강제 오류가 발생했다는 것을 쉽게 감지할 수 있기 때문이다. 또한 이러한 방식으로 트랜잭션을 처리한다고 하더라도 이는 이미 강제 오류가 발생한 상태를 기준으로 진행된 것이기 때문에 이후의 모든 상태값 또한 유효하지 않은 값이 된다. 요컨대, 롤업은 강제 오류를 발생시키기에 매우 까다로운 구조를 갖고 있는 것이다.</p>\\n<h3>Multiple Solvers — Truebit</h3>\\n<p>트루빗의 <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11476.pdf\">다중 해결자</a> 모델은 앞서 제시된 잭팟 모델의 여러 단점을 해결하고, 검증자의 딜레마를 완전히 해소하기 위해 새롭게 제시한 방법이다. 기존 트루빗이 3개의 역할군, 의뢰인, 해결자, 검증자가 명확하게 구분되어 있었다면, 다중 해결자 모델에서는 오직 의뢰인과 해결자만이 존재한다. 단, 하나의 해결자가 아닌 다수의 해결자를 두어 소수의 특정 해결자에 의해 안전성이 위협받는것을 방지한다.</p>\\n<p>다중 해결자 모델에서는 의뢰인이 작업을 의뢰하면, 해결자 풀(Pool)에서 랜덤하게 선택된 다수의 해결자가 해당 작업에 배정된다. 각 해결자는 작업에 대한 솔루션과 독립 실행 증명(Proof of Independent Execution)을 제출한다. 독립 실행 증명은 말 그대로 각 해결자가 스스로 작업을 해결했는지를 증명하는 과정이다. <em>독립 실행 증명이 구체적으로 어떻게 구성되는지는 </em><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11476.pdf\"><em>여기</em></a><em>서 확인하라.</em> 이를 통해 각 해결자는 다른 해결자의 솔루션을 복제하지 않았음을 증명할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>작업에 배정된 모든 해결자들은 스스로 작업을 수행하고 이에 대한 올바른 솔루션을 제출하지 않으면, 다른 해결자나 외부의 검증자(작업에 배정된 해결자가 아니더라도 여전히 누구나 검증은 수행할 수 있다)에 의해 챌린지 되어 자신의 예치금을 몰수당할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>단, 각 해결자들은 작업을 올바르게 수행한다면 이에 대한 보상으로 수수료를 받을 수 있고, 이 수수료가 검증 비용보다 높다면 해결자들은 항상 작업을 올바르게 수행할 유인이 있다고 할 수 있다. 즉, 다중 해결자 모델은 검증 작업과 작업을 해결하는 과정이 본질적으로 다르지 않다는 것을 파악하고, 이에 대한 보상을 명시적으로 주어 검증자의 딜레마를 해소한다.</p>\\n<p>하지만 다중 해결자는 한가지 치명적인 단점이 존재하는데, 바로 <strong>많은 비용</strong>을 필요로 한다는 것이다. 다중 해결자 모델은 각 작업에 배정되는 해결자의 수가 많으면 많을수록 더 높은 수준의 안전성을 보장할 수 있게 된다. 이는 곧 해결자에게 지불하는 수수료가 필연적으로 높아질 수 밖에 없음을 의미한다.</p>\\n<p>때문에 트루빗은 의뢰인이 원하는 안전성 수준에 따라 수수료를 지불할 수 있도록 한다. 더 높은 수준의 안전성을 원한다면 수수료를 많이 지불하여 더 많은 해결자들이 작업을 수행하도록 할 수 있고, 그렇지 않은 경우 수수료를 최소한으로 지불하여 소수의 해결자들이 작업을 수행하도록 할 수 있다.</p>\\n<h4>Application to Rollup</h4>\\n<p>다중 해결자 모델의 핵심은 해결자와 검증자를 별도로 분리하지 않고, 이를 하나로 통합하고 작업을 해결(검증)한 행위에 직접적으로 보상을 주는것에 있다. 즉, 롤업에서 이와 유사한 방식을 적용하려면 시퀀서와 검증자를 별도로 분리하는게 아니라 특정 트랜잭션을 처리할 때 하나의 시퀀서가 아니라 다수의 시퀀서가 각자 독립적으로 이를 실행한 후 이에 대한 상태 결과값을 레이어 1에 제출하도록 해야 한다.</p>\\n<p>중요한 점은 롤업을 가능한 안전하게 유지하기 위해 다수의 시퀀서에게 적절한 보상을 주어야 한다는 것인데, 이는 크게 사용자에게 추가적인 수수료를 받거나 생태계에서 발행되는 토큰 보상으로 방식으로 해결할 수 있다. 다만, 높은 수준의 안전성을 위해서는 더 많은 수수료와 더 많은 토큰 보상이 필요하므로 적절한 수준의 안전성과 비용 기준을 구체적으로 마련할 필요가 있다.</p>\\n<p>더불어, 기존의 롤업의 경우 레이어 1에 필요한 상호작용이 트랜잭션 데이터를 공유하는 행위와 트랜잭션을 처리한 후의 상태값을 저장하는 행위로 제한되었지만, 다중 시퀀서 모델을 도입할 경우 시퀀서의 수에 비례하여 상태값을 저장하는 행위와 독립 실행 증명에 필요한 트랜잭션 수가 선형적으로 증가한다. 이는 롤업의 본래 목적인 레이어 1의 확장성을 높이는 목적과 상충할 수 있다는 점에 유의해야 한다.</p>\\n<h3>Attention Challenge — Arbitrum</h3>\\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/offchainlabs/cheater-checking-how-attention-challenges-solve-the-verifiers-dilemma-681a92d9948e\">주의 챌린지(Attention Challenge)</a>는 검증자에게 올바르게 검증 작업을 수행하지 않았을 경우 이를 처벌하여 검증자의 딜레마를 해결하고자 한다. 주의 챌린지의 핵심은 검증자에게 추가적인 보상을 주어 검증을 독려하는 것이 아니라, 검증을 하지 않았을 경우 검증자에게 중대한 손실을 입혀 검증을 할 수 밖에 없도록 만드는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>주의 챌린지가 구체적으로 어떻게 작동하는지 알아보기 위해 앞서 다룬 Super-Simple Model로 돌아가보자. 이 단순한 모델에서는 두 참가자인 주장자, 검증자가 존재했다. 이 때 주장자가 어떠한 값 f(x)를 연산한다고 할 때, 이 값을 그대로 제출하지 않고 오직 x와 암호화된 f(x)만을 제출한다. 이 때 검증자는 x를 확인하고 올바른 f(x)값을 반드시 제출하여야 한다. 만약 검증자가 올바르지 않은 값을 제출하거나 정해진 시간에 응답하지 않을 경우 자신의 보증금을 잃게 된다.</p>\\n<p>물론, 주의 챌린지에 응답하기 위해서는 온체인(on-chain) 트랜잭션이 필요하므로, 항상 검증자가 주의 챌린지에 응답해야 한다면 이는 레이어 1과 검증자에게 많은 부담이 될 것이다. 따라서, 주의 챌린지는 각 검증자에게 항상 적용되는 것이 아니라 확률적으로 적용된다. 단, 각 검증자가 주의 챌린지의 응답 대상이 되었는지는 오직 스스로 검증 작업을 수행한 후에만 확인할 수 있게 설계된다. 따라서 검증자들은 오프체인(off-chain)에서 f(x)를 연산하여 항상 검증작업을 수행하지만 오직 주의 챌린지의 대상이 되었을 경우에만 이러한 값들을 온체인에 제출하게 된다.</p>\\n<p><em>구체적으로 f(x)가 어떻게 암호화되는지, 각 검증자들이 어떻게 챌린지의 응답 대상이 되었는지 확인하는지에 대한 기술적인 사항들은 </em><a href=\"https://medium.com/offchainlabs/cheater-checking-how-attention-challenges-solve-the-verifiers-dilemma-681a92d9948e\"><em>원 글</em></a><em>을 참고하라.</em></p>\\n<p>Super-Simple Model에 주의 챌린지를 적용할 경우 검증자의 검증 및 비검증 기대 보수는 다음과 같이 변경된다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>검증 기대 보수: R*X-C</li>\\n<li>비검증 기대 보수: -L*X -P*A</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><em>P는 주의 챌린지의 응답 대상이 될 확률이고, A는 잘못된 응답을 제출했을 때 몰수되는 보증금을 의미한다.</em></p>\\n<p>이 때, P*A &gt; C 이면 검증자는 주장자의 공격 확률인 X와 관계 없이 항상 검증을 하는것이 최선의 선택이 된다. P와 A에 대한 적절한 변수값은 시스템에 의해 통제될 수 있으므로, 검증자로 하여금 항상 검증을 하도록 유도할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>주의 챌린지는 사용자에게 별도의 추가적인 비용을 발생시키지 않고, 검증자로 하여금 항상 검증을 하도록 유도할 수 있다는 점에서 매우 매력적이다. 하지만 주의 챌린지에는 한가지 맹점이 존재하는데, 만약 검증자가 검증을 수행하면서 주장자가 어떠한 공격도 하지 않아 이에 대한 보상을 얻지 못할 경우, 모든 경우에 대해 손실을 볼 수 있다는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>예를 들어, 아래와 같은 조건에서 검증자의 기대 보수는 다음과 같이 나타낼 수 있다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>R = 100</li>\\n<li>L = 10</li>\\n<li>X = 0</li>\\n<li>C = 1</li>\\n<li>P*A = 5</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ol>\\n<li>검증 기대 보수 = -1</li>\\n<li>비검증 기대 보수 = -5</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>이 때, 검증자는 검증 기대 보수(-1)가 비검증 기대 보수(-5)보다 더 크므로 검증을 하게 될 것이다. 하지만 여기에는 한가지 <strong>함정</strong>이 존재한다. 바로 어떠한 선택을 하더라도 검증자는 <strong>순수하게 손실</strong>만 입는다는 것이다! 즉, 검증자는 더 큰 손실을 피하기 위해 작은 손실을 감수하는 상황에 처하게 되는 것이다. 만약 검증자가 강제로 이러한 상황에 놓이게 된다면 별다른 방법이 없겠지만, 이를 시스템적으로 강제할수는 없을 것이다. 즉, 검증자가 원하면 검증자의 역할을 포기하고 보증금을 인출하여 이 시스템을 떠날 수 있다는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>만약 여러분이 이 검증자라면 어떤 선택을 하겠는가? 기약없는 수익을 기다리며 이 시스템에 남아 검증을 계속하겠는가? 또는 어차피 나에게 주어지는 보상은 아무것도 없고, 비용만 지출되니 검증자를 포기하고 떠나겠는가? 아마 모든 이들은 후자를 선택할 것이다.</p>\\n<p>이 예시를 통해 알 수 있는 것은 주의 챌린지는 검증자가 항상 비검증이 아닌 검증 전략을 선택하도록 유도할수는 있지만, 검증자가 계속해서 검증자의 역할을 지속적으로 수행하도록 유도하지는 못한다는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>그렇다면 주의 챌린지는 아무런 효용도 없는 장치인가? 그렇지 않다. 주의 챌린지는 검증자의 딜레마를 해결하는데 매우 효과적인 장치이다. 단, 주의 챌린지의 대상이 되는 검증자들이 검증 작업과 연관된 또는 연관되지 않은 일정한 수익을 얻을 수 있을때만 그 효과를 발휘한다.</p>\\n<p>예를 들어, 검증자가 검증 단위마다 일정한 수익 F를 얻는다면, F - C &gt; -P*A 일 때, 검증자는 항상 검증 전략을 선택하고 더불어 검증자의 역할을 계속해서 수행하지 않을 이유를 찾기가 어려울 것이다. 우리는 이러한 조건이 적용될 수 있는 모델을 하나 알고 있다. 바로 롤업이다!</p>\\n<h4>Application to Rollup</h4>\\n<p>롤업에서는 검증자의 역할이 명확히 구분되지 않고, 여러 구성원들이 검증자의 역할을 겸하게 된다. 그리고 이러한 구성원 중 일부는 검증 단위인 트랜잭션마다 일정한 수익을 얻는다. 예를 들어, 롤업에서 이자 농사(Yield Farming)를 하고 있는 사용자나 DEX를 운영하는 개발자는 트랜잭션이 처리될 때마다 일정한 수익을 얻을 수 있다. 이러한 경우 주의 챌린지를 적용하면 이들 구성원이 확실하게 롤업을 검증할 수 있도록 유도할 수 있다. 이에 대한 자세한 내용은 이미 앞에서 다루었기 때문에 추가적인 설명은 생략하겠다.</p>\\n<h3>Why do I care so much about Verifier’s Dilemma?</h3>\\n<p>이 글은 지속적으로 롤업의 모든 구성원들에게 안전을 보장하기 위해서는 검증자의 딜레마를 반드시 고려해야하고, 이에 대한 적절한 해결책을 고려할 필요성이 있다고 주장하고 있다. 이에 대한 여러가지 근거를 앞에서 제시했지만, 여전히 이에 동의하지 않는 사람들이 있을 수 있다. 이는 어디까지나 이론적인 측면일 뿐, 실제로 롤업이 활발하게 도입되어 사용될 때, 막상 검증자의 딜레마가 크게 문제가 되지 않을 수 있기 때문이다. 세상에는 자신에게 아무런 이익이 되지 않아도 다른 이들을 도와주는 이타적인 사람들도 있고, 또한 자신의 이익을 극대화하기 보다 이익을 조금 포기하더라도 스스로와 다른 사람들을 위해 차선을 선택하는 이들도 있다. 롤업에서도 이와 비슷한 상황이 전개될수도 있다.</p>\\n<p><strong>하지만 이 글에서 주장하고 싶은것은 롤업에서 검증자의 딜레마를 고려하지 않는다면 해당 롤업은 ‘반드시’ 위험에 빠지게 될 것이라는 것이 아니다. 다만, 이러한 측면을 사전에 주의 깊게 고려하지 않는다면 매우 낮은 확률이라도 예상치 못한 위기가 닥쳤을 때, 롤업의 안전성이 크게 위협받을 ‘가능성’이 있다는 것이다.</strong></p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*I_nF8NFH0P57hBRPrgeoXw.png\"><figcaption>(Source:

될 것이고, 낙차가 높은 곳에서 떨어질 일도 없을 것이기 때문에 값비싼 충격 완화 장치를 추가할 필요도 없다. 사막을 달릴 일도 없을 것이기 때문에 모래 먼지를 고려할 필요도 없고, 폭설과 폭우에도 그렇게 많은 신경을 쓸 필요가 없다. 어차피 그런 일은 잘 일어나지도 않을 뿐더러 도로 또한 항상 잘 정비되어 있을 것이기 때문에 평범한 차도 무리 없이 잘 달릴 수 있을 것이다.</p>\\n<p>하지만 반대로, 어떤 종류의 극한 환경에서도 항상 문제 없이 잘 달릴 수 있는 차를 설계하고자 한다면 이야기는 완전히 달라진다. 만약 충분한 안전장치가 없다면 이러한 환경에서는 운전자와 승객의 생명을 크게 위협할 수도 있다. 때문에, 추가적인 비용이 발생하고 설계가 다소 복잡해지더라도 가능한 차를 안전하게 설계하는것이 최우선사항이다. 이렇게 설계된 차 또한 물론 대부분의 주행이 도시 환경에서 이루어질 수도 있다. 이런 상황에서는 이 차에 들어간 여러 비용과 설비가 다소 불필요하고 과하게 느껴질 수도 있다. 하지만 이 차는 극한 환경에 처했을 때 그 진가를 발휘할 것이다. 갑자기 폭설이 쏟아져 다른 모든 평범한 차들은 한 치도 움직일 수 없을 때, 이 차는 홀로 문제 없이 잘 달릴 것이다.</p>\\n<p>다시 롤업과 블록체인의 이야기로 돌아와서, 여러분은 이 두가지 종류의 차 중에 어떤 것이 롤업에 가깝다고 생각하는가? 나는 블록체인을 믿는 사람이라면 누구나 롤업, 아니 나아가 모든 블록체인 기술은 후자의 성격에 더 가깝다는것에 동의할 것이라 믿는다. 블록체인 기술은 <a href=\"https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274\">탈중앙화를 통해 시스템이 처할 수 있는 모든 극한 환경을 극복(장애 허용, 공격 저항, 담합 저항)</a>하고자 한다. 비록 그것이 매우 드물게 발생하는 상황일지라도 말이다. 롤업 또한 마찬가지다. 롤업은 극한 상황에 대한 대처 능력을 레이어 1과 동일한 수준에 가깝게 구현하되, 레이어 1의 부족한 확장성을 대폭 증가시키기 위한 기술이다. 따라서 우리는 롤업이 이러한 목적대로 모든 극한 환경을 잘 극복할 수 있도록 노력할 필요가 있다.</p>\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\n<p>옵티미스틱 롤업은 당면한 이더리움의 확장성 문제를 중단기적으로, 또한 장기적으로도 획기적으로 해결할 수 있을 것으로 기대되는 레이어 2 솔루션이다. 물론, 현재까지 많은 레이어 2 솔루션이 제시되었고, 특히 유효성 증명(Validity Proof)을 활용하는 zk-롤업(zk-Rollup)은 옵티미스틱 롤업과 다르게 즉시 완결성(Finality)을 부여할 수 있다는 측면에서 각광을 받고 있다. 하지만, 이더리움의 모든 복잡한 트랜잭션들을 zk-롤업으로 처리하기에는 현 시점에서 분명한 한계가 존재하기 때문에, 당분간 이더리움을 위한 현실적인 주요 대안은 옵티미스틱 롤업이 될 것이다.</p>\\n<p>앞으로 옵티미스틱 롤업은 매우 광범위하게 활용될 것이고, 매우 대중화(Mass Adoption)될 것이다. 롤업의 수가 많아지고, 그 규모가 커질수록 안전성에 대한 이슈는 더욱 더 중요해질 것이다. 계속해서 강조하지만, 롤업은 단 한명의 정직한 검증자만 존재해도 시스템이 안전하게 유지될 수 있다는 점에서 매우 매력적인 레이어 2이다.</p>\\n<p>하지만 이 글에서 계속해서 논의한 바와 같이, 롤업에서 검증자는 시퀀서의 공격확률이 높지 않다면 검증을 할 유인보다는 그렇지 않을 유인이 더 크다. 때문에 롤업이 안전하게 동작하는 시간이 늘어날수록 활성화된 검증자의 수는 빠르게 줄어들 것이다. 빠른 출금 및 크로스 롤업 트랜잭션의 중개인들 또한 완전한 예외는 아니다. 요컨대, 롤업은 역설적으로 안전해질수록 위험해질것이다. 하지만 우리는 한가지 대안을 알고 있다. 바로 주의 챌린지를 적절하게 적용하는 것이다. 주의 챌린지를 적용할 경우 우리는 롤업의 안전성을 확실하게 보장할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>물론, 이 글은 모든 롤업에 주의 챌린지를 반드시 적용해야 한다고 주장하는 것은 아니다. 각 롤업마다 목표로 하는 수준의 안전성이 있을 것이고, 참가자들의 성향에 대한 가정이 있을 것이다. 만약 높은 안전성을 보장하지 않아도 되거나, 이타주의자, 위험을 극도로 회피하는 참가자들의 비율이 충분히 높다고 판단된다면 굳이 주의 챌린지를 적용할 필요는 없다. 중요한것은 각자의 목적에 맞게 필요한 도구를 적절하게 사용하는 것이다. 이 글이 각 롤업의 안전성을 설계할 때 조금이나마 도움이 되었으면 한다.</p>\\n<h3>Glossary</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>시퀀서: 옵티미스틱 롤업에서 사용자들의 트랜잭션 순서를 결정하고, 해당 트랜잭션들을 처리한 후의 상태값과 트랜잭션

      '\\n<h3>Optimistic Rollup is Not Secure Enough Than You Think — Game Theoretic Approach for More Verifiable Rollup</h3>\\n<h3>Intro</h3>\\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/optimistic_rollups/\">옵티미스틱 롤업(Optimistic Rollup, 이하 롤업)</a>은 이더리움 커뮤니티가 레이어 2 솔루션인 <a href=\"https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/plasma/\">플라즈마</a>의 문제점을 해결하기 위해 고민하고 있을 때, 이를 해결하기 위해 혜성처럼 등장한 또 다른 레이어 2 솔루션이다. 롤업의 가장 큰 장점은 플라즈마와 달리 <a href=\"https://medium.com/starkware/validity-proofs-vs-fraud-proofs-4ef8b4d3d87a\">위조 증명(Fraud Proof)</a>을 통해 모든 사용자가 롤업을 감시하지 않고, 최소한 단 한명의 정직한 검증자만 있다면 안전성(Security)을 보장할 수 있다는 것이다. 이는 롤업이 플라즈마에 비해 확장성을 대폭 희생한다는 단점에도 불구하고, 이더리움 커뮤니티의 전폭적인 지지를 얻게된 주요 요인이었다.</p>\\n<p>롤업은 말 그대로 단 한명의 정직한 검증자(Honest Verifier)만 존재해도 안전하게 동작할 수 있는 아주 매력적인 레이어 2 이다. 하지만 블록체인 세계에 살고 있는 우리는 의심이 아주 많은 사람들이기 때문에, 롤업이 정말 안전하게 작동한다고 확신할 수 있는가에 대한 의문이 생긴다. 사실 이런 의문들은 아주 새로운 것은 아니다. 검증자의 딜레마(Verifier’s Dilemma)라는 개념으로 꽤 오랜 기간동안 많은 연구자들은 롤업 뿐 아니라 검증이 필요한 다양한 분야에서 올바르게 검증이 이루어질 수 있는가에 대해 논의해왔다. 롤업 또한 이와 비슷한 논의가 이루어져 왔고, 이에 대한 의견은 크게 두 갈래로 나뉜다. 한 쪽은 롤업에서 <a href=\"https://research.paradigm.xyz/rollups\">검증자의 딜레마를 ‘전혀’ 고려할 필요가 없다고 주장하며</a>, 다른 한 쪽은 롤업이 장기적으로 안전하게 동작하기 위해서는 <a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html\">반드시 검증자의 딜레마를 고려해야 한다고 이야기 한다.</a></p>\\n<p>도대체 누구의 말이 맞는 것일까? 설계자가 아닌 사용자의 입장에서 우리는 롤업을 정말 안전하게 사용할 수 있는 것인가? 만약에 확실히 안전한것이 아니라면 우리는 어떻게 해야 하는가? 이 글에서는 이러한 모든 의문들을 모두 해소하고, 롤업의 안전성을 보장하기 위해 장기적으로 어떠한 방향으로 나아가야 할지에 대한 구체적인 방법을 제시할 것이다.</p>\\n<p><em>이 글에서 다루는 모든 논의들은 비단 옵티미스틱 롤업뿐만 아니라 위조 증명(Fruad Proof)을 이용하는 모든 확장성 솔루션에 적용 될 수 있다.</em></p>\\n<h3>Verifier’s Dilemma</h3>\\n<p>롤업의 안전성에 대한 문제를 다루기 전에 반드시 짚고 넘어가야할 개념이 있다. 바로 앞서 소개글에서도 언급 했던 검증자의 딜레마이다. 검증자의 딜레마란 일반적으로 블록체인 세계에서 한 참가자가 어떠한 연산을 수행하고 다른 한 참가자가 해당 작업을 검증하여 네트워크 혹은 프로토콜의 안전성을 유지할 때, 검증에 대한 효용이 명확하지 않은 경우에 발생하는 일련의 문제들을 의미한다.</p>\\n<p>검증자의 딜레마는 <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/702.pdf\">이 글</a>에서 최초로 논의된 개념으로 쉽게 풀어 쓰면 다음과 같이 설명할 수 있다. 비트코인과 이더리움과 같은 블록체인에서는 블록을 최초로 마이닝한 마이너가 네트워크의 다른 노드에게 블록을 전파할 때, 다른 노드들은 모두 블록의 유효성을 검증한다. 이것이 원래 컨센서스가 의도한 바이며, 네트워크의 안전성 측면에서 블록을 전파받은 모든 다른 노드들은 이를 반드시 검증하는것이 바람직하다.</p>\\n<p>하지만 개별 노드의 연산력은 유한하기 때문에 복잡한 트랜잭션을 검증하는데 사용될 연산력을 다음 블록을 마이닝하는 작업에 할당하는것이 경제적으로 더 유리할 수 있다. 물론, 유효하지 않은 블록을 조상 블록으로 하는 블록은 네트워크에서 인정받을 수 없기 때문에 이러한 위험을 감수해야 한다. 따라서, 개별 노드들은 검증을 수행하는것이 유리한지, 혹은 검증을 하지 않고 마이닝에만 집중하는것이 유리한지 선택해야하는 상황에 끊임 없이 빠지게 된다.</p>\\n<p>이러한 검증자의 딜레마는 롤업에서도 유사한 방식으로 적용될 수 있다. 롤업에서는 시퀀서가 레이어 2에서 발생한 트랜잭션들을 처리한 후, 해당 상태값들의 요약본과 개별 트랜잭션 데이터만을 레이어 1에 제출한다.</p>\\n<p><em>시퀀서 또는 오퍼레이터는 롤업에서 사용자의 트랜잭션의 순서를 결정하고, 이를 레이어 1에 제출하는 역할을 수행한다. 이 글에서는 시퀀서라는 용어를 사용한다.</em></p>\\n<p>이 때 시퀀서가 올바르지 않은 상태값을 제출할 수 있기 때문에, 롤업에서는 <a href=\"https://medium.com/starkware/validity-proofs-vs-fraud-proofs-4ef8b4d3d87a\">위조 증명(Fraud Proof)</a>과 DTD(Dispute Time Delay)를 두어 이를 예방한다. 롤업 내외부의 모든 사용자들은 롤업의 검증자가 될 수 있으며, 위조 증명을 통해 DTD내에 유효하지 않은 값이 확정(Finalize)되는 것을 방지할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>만약 검증자가 위조 증명에 성공한다면 시퀀서가 예치한 보증금의 일부 혹은 전부를 보상으로 받을 수 있다. 하지만 여기서 한가지 문제가 발생한다. 만약에 시퀀서가 항상 올바른 값만 제출한다면? 검증자는 아무리 검증 작업을 수행해도 위조 증명을 성공하지 못할 것이고, 이는 곧 검증에 대한 유인을 잃게 만든다. 하지만 시퀀서가 계속해서 올바른 값만 제출하는것이 원래 롤업이 의도한 안전성이 아니냐고 반문할 수 있다. 이것이 왜 문제가 되는지 살펴보자.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>검증자는 시퀀서가 제출한 상태값이 올바른지 항상 검증한다.</li>\\n<li>시퀀서는 올바르지 않은 값을 제출하면 위조 증명에 의해 보증금을 몰수 당하므로 계속해서 올바른 상태값만 제출한다.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>검증자는 시퀀서가 계속해서 올바른 값만 제출하므로 검증 작업에 대한 보상을

운영 될수록 검증에 대한 유인은 더 감소하게 된다는 것이다. 이는 굉장히 역설적인데, 롤업이 안전해질수록 더 위험해지고, 더 위험해질수록 더 안전해지기 때문이다. 이 논리에 따르면, 한눈에 봐도 검증자의 딜레마는 롤업의 안전성을 심각하게 위해할 수 있는 요소로 보인다. 과연 검증자의 딜레마는 정말 롤업의 위협요소일까? 다음 장에서 더 깊게 파헤쳐보자.</p>\\n<h3>Super-Simple Model</h3>\\n<p>복잡한 개념이나 문제를 이해하고 해결하기 위해서 가장 좋은 방법은 언제나 문제를 단순화하는 것이다. 따라서 우리는 롤업의 검증자의 딜레마에 대해 본격적으로 논의하기에 앞서, 이를 매우 단순화한 Super-Simple Model을 먼저 살펴볼 것이다.</p>\\n<p>Super-Simple Model<em>은 Ed Felten의 글 </em><a

주장자(Asserter, 이하 A)로 단순히 참 혹은 거짓만 제시한다. 다른 한명은 검증자(Verifier, 이하 V)로 검증에 필요한 비용을 지불하고 A의 주장을 검증하거나 또는 A가 참을 주장했을 것이라 가정하고 검증하지 않는 것을 선택할 수 있다. 만약 A의 주장이 거짓이고 V가 이를 검증하는데 성공했다면 A의 보증금을 보상으로 받게 된다.</p>\\n<p>반대로 A가 거짓을 주장했음에도 불구하고 V가 이를 고발하지 않는다면 V의 보증금이 A에게 보상으로 주어진다. 즉, 이 시스템의 목적은 A가 거짓 주장을 하더라도 V가 이를 검증하여 항상 참만 주장되도록 유지하는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>이러한 목적을 달성하기 위해 우리가 고려해야 할 위험요소는 두가지가 있다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>뇌물 수수 공격(Bribery attack)</li>\\n<li>검증자의 나태(Laziness)</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>뇌물 수수 공격은 주장자가 검증자를 뇌물로 매수하여 거짓을 주장하더라도 이를 검증하지 않도록 사전에 합의하는 것을 말한다. 이러한 공격 방식은 주장자와 검증자의 담보물의 가치를 높이거나 이해관계자의 수를 늘리는 것으로 비교적 쉽게 해결이 가능하다.</p>\\n<p>검증자의 나태는 말 그대로 검증자가 검증작업을 수행하지 않아 발생하는 문제를 의미한다. 검증 작업이 수행되지 않는다면, 주장자는 얼마든지 거짓을 계속해서 주장할 수 있게 된다. 검증자의 나태는 뇌물 수수 공격과 달리 담보물의 가치를 높이거나 이해관계자의 수를 단순히 늘리는 것으로는 해결이 쉽지 않다. 그 이유를 아래에서 자세히 살펴보도록 하자.</p>\\n<p>검증자의 나태를 막기 위해서는 먼저 검증자가 어떠한 기준으로 검증 또는 비검증 전략을 선택하는지 파악할 필요가 있다.</p>\\n<p>다음과 같은 조건하에 검증자가 각 전략을 선택했을 때의 기대 보수는 아래와 같이 나타낼 수 있다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>R = A의 보증금, A가 거짓을 주장하고 V가 검증에 성공할 경우 V에게 보상으로 주어진다.</li>\\n<li>L = V의 보증금, A가 거짓을 주장하고 V가 검증에 실패할 경우 A에게 보상으로 주어진다.</li>\\n<li>X = A가 공격할 확률</li>\\n<li>C = 검증 비용</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ol>\\n<li>검증 기대 보수: R*X-C</li>\\n<li>비검증 기대 보수: -L*X</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>이 때, 우리는 V의 검증 보수가 비검증 보수보다 크다면<strong>(R*X- C &gt; -L*X)</strong> V는 항상 A의 주장을 검증을 할 것이라 쉽게 예측할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>즉, <strong>X &gt; C/(R+L)</strong> 이면 검증자의 나태를 방지할 수 있는 것이다. 반대로 <strong>X &lt; C/(R+L)</strong><em>라면 V는 A의 주장을 검증하지 않을 것이다. (두 항이 같은 경우는 어떤 선택을 하더라도 기대 보수가 무차별해지는 지점이다. 즉 V는 A의 주장을 검증할수도 있고, 하지 않을수도 있다.)</em></p>\\n<p>그렇다면 우리에게 필요한것은 <strong>X를 C/(R+L)보다 더 크게 만드는 것이다.</strong> 그러면 V는 항상 A의 주장을 검증하게 될 것이고 이 단순한 시스템은 항상 안전하게 유지될 것이다!</p>\\n<p>하지만 문제는 X는 A의 공격 확률을 의미하고, 이는 곧 <strong>X의 값은 A에 의해 결정</strong>된다는 것이다. 만약 X가 충분히 낮도록 A가 공격행위의 빈도수와 시기를 적절하게 조절한다면 V는 검증 효용이 비검증 효용보다 낮기 때문에 검증하지 않는 것을 선택하게 되고, A의 거짓 주장을 효과적으로 방어할 수 없게 된다. 이는 곧 이 단순한 시스템의 안전성이 무너질 수 있다는것을 의미한다.</p>\\n<p>여기서 누군가는 “R+L을 최대한 높여 효과적인 X의 수치를 충분히 낮추게 되면 시스템은 더 안전해질 수 있다”고 주장할 것이다. 다시 말해, 이 시스템의 참여 조건에 해당하는 자본 제한(Capital Requirement)을 가능한 최대로 늘려 A와 V의 요구 보증금액을 높이자는 것이다. 하지만 이는 다음과 같은 두가지 측면에서 한계가 분명하다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>R과 L이 아무리 높은 수치라도, 그 수치가 사전에 결정되는 순간 A는 효과적인 공격 확률을 계산할 수 있다. 이를 통해 A는 여전히 V의 검증에 대한 유인을 감소시킬 수 있다.</li>\\n<li>자본 제한을 높이는 것은 참여에 대한 진입장벽을 높여 오직 소수만이 이 시스템에 참여할 수 있게 제한한다. 이는 곧 해당 시스템의 도입과 확장에 매우 부정적인 영향을 끼치게 된다.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>또 다른 아이디어는 검증자의 수를 늘리면 이 딜레마를 해결할 수 있다는 것이다. <strong>하지만 검증자의 수를 단순히 늘리는 것은 뇌물수수 공격(Bribery attack)을 예방하는 것에는 큰 도움이 되지만, 검증자의 나태를 해결하는 것에는 오히려 악영향을 끼치게 된다.</strong></p>\\n<p>뇌물 수수 공격을 예방하는데 도움이 되는 이유는, 주장자가 검증자를 매수하기 위해서는 각 검증자에게 R보다 큰 보상을 지급해야 하기 때문이다. 만약 검증자의 수가 N명이고, 거짓을 주장하여 얻는 총 이익이 M이라고 할 때, M/N &gt; R 일 경우에만 모든 검증자들을 매수할 수 있을 것이다. 따라서 N이 커질수록 주장자는 뇌물 수수 공격을 수행하는것이 어려워진다.</p>\\n<p><em>이론적으로 롤업에서 단 한명의 검증자만 있어도 안전하게 동작할 수 있지만, 반대로 이는 시퀀서의 뇌물수수 공격에 취약해질 수 있기 때문에 가능한 다수의 올바른 검증자를 확보하는것이 매우 중요하다고 할 수 있다.</em></p>\\n<p>반대로, 검증자의 수를 늘리는 것이 검증자의 나태를 해결하는 것에 별 도움이 안되는 이유는 검증자의 수가 증가할수록 비검증 효용은 그대로인 반면, <strong>검증에 대한 기대 보상은 검증자의 수에 비례하여 감소하기 때문이다.</strong> 이는 매우 자명한 사실인데, 예를 들어, 검증자가 두명일 때 두 검증자 모두 검증에 성공한다면 보상 R을 어떠한 비율(K)로든 나누게 될 것이고, 이는 검증자가 단 한명일 때의 보상 R보다 낮은 금액(R/K)일 것이기 때문이다.</p>\\n<p>이 단순한 모델에 따르면, 검증자의 딜레마란 꽤 복잡한 문제이며 이를 해결하는것은 상당히 어려워 보인다. 하지만 이 모델은 정확히 롤업을 모방한것은 아니다. 롤업에서는 이러한 문제가 해결될수도 있지 않을까? 이에 대해 다음 장에서 더 자세히 살펴보도록 하자.</p>\\n<h3>Super-Simple Model in Optimistic Rollup</h3>\\n<p>앞서 다루었던 단순한 모델을 바탕으로 롤업에서의 Super-Simple Model을 구성하여 롤업에서 검증자의 딜레마와 관련하여 어떠한 문제가 있을지 살펴보자. 사실 앞의 모델에서 변경되는 부분은 많지 않다. 주장자가 시퀀서(Sequencer, S)로, 검증자는 그대로 검증자가 된다. 이 때 검증자는 롤업의 이해관계자라고 가정한다. 즉, 검증자는 롤업에 일정한 경제적/비경제적 자산이 있거나, 롤업을 통해 주기적으로 일정한 경제적/비경제적 수익을 얻는 자이다.</p>\\n<p>이 때, 다음과 같은 조건하에 검증자 V의 검증 및 비검증 기대보수는 다음과 같다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>R = S의 보증금, V가 검증에 성공할 시 V에게 보상으로 주어진다.</li>\\n<li>L = V의 롤업에 예치된 자산, V가 검증에 실패할 시 S에게 보상으로 주어질 수 있다.</li>\\n<li>X = S가 공격할 확률</li>\\n<li>C = 검증 비용</li>\\n<li>F = 검증 단위당 V가 얻는 수익(예를 들어, V가 롤업의 트랜잭션 T마다 일정한 수익을 얻을 때, 이를 F라고 한다)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>단, R,L &gt; F &gt; C &gt; 0 이다.</em></p>\\n<p><em>또한 편의상 F는 L에 누적해서 포함되지 않는다고 가정하겠다. 이러한 가정은 이후에 다룰 모든 모델에서 동일하게 적용될 것이다.</em></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>검증 기대 보수: R*X + F -C</li>\\n<li>비검증 기대 보수: -L*X + (1-X)F</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><em>검증을 하지 않더라도 시퀀서가 공격 행위를 수행하지 않으면 검증자는 여전히 F의 수익을 얻을 수 있다는것에 유의하라.</em></p>\\n<p>이 때, Super-Simple Model과 동일하게 검증 보수가 비검증 보수보다 크다면 검증자는 항상 검증할 유인이 있다고 할 수 있다. 즉, 시퀀서의 공격확률이 다음과 같은 경우에 검증자는 검증 전략을 선택하게 된다.</p>\\n<ul><li><strong>X &gt; C/(R+L+F)</strong></li></ul>\\n<p>이전의 모델과 달라진 것은 오직 분모에 F가 추가되었다는 것이다. 이는 시퀀서의 공격확률을 소폭 감소시키는 효과를 낼 수 있겠지만, 근본적인 문제점은 동일하게 존재한다.</p>\\n<p>즉, <strong>검증자의 전략적 선택은 여전히 시퀀서의 공격 확률에 의존</strong>하고 있으며, 이는 새로운 변수인 검증 단위당 검증자가 얻는 일정한 수익(F)을 고려하더라도 크게 달라지지 않는다는것을 알 수 있다. 이는 시퀀서의 공격이 매우 간헐적으로 일어나거나 또는 일어나지 않는다면, 검증자는 검증 비용 없이 계속해서 온전한 수익을 얻을 수 있기 때문이다.</p>\\n<p>우리는 어떻게 이 문제를 해결할 수 있을까? R과 L, 즉 자본 제한을 높이는 방법은 명확한 한계가 있다는 것은 이미 논의가 되었다. 한가지 우리가 생각할 수 있는 것은 롤업이 다수의 검증자들 중 단 한명의 검증자 만이라도 검증을 올바르게 수행하면 시스템의 안전성이 유지될 수 있다는 것이다. 그렇다면 단순한 모델에서 확장된 모델로 변경하여 검증자의 수를 늘리면 이들 중 누군가 한명쯤은 검증을 할 것이라 기대할 수 있지 않을까? 그리하여 롤업의 안전성도 지켜질 수 있지 않을까?</p>\\n<h3>Multiple Verifiers</h3>\\n<p>본격적으로 검증자의 수를 다수(N)로 늘리기 전에 먼저 이를 아주 단순화한 모델로부터 시작해보자. 즉, 검증자는 이제 1명이 아니라 <strong>단 2명</strong>이다. 두명의 검증자는 V1, V2이고, 시퀀서 S는 여전히 동일하다.</p>\\n<p>이 때, 다음과 같은 조건하에 각 검증자의 검증 및 비검증 기대 보수는 다음과 같이 나타낼 수 있다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>R = S의 보증금, V가 검증에 성공할 시 V에게 보상으로 주어진다.</li>\\n<li>L = V(N)의 롤업에 예치된 자산, V가 검증에 실패할 시 S에게 보상으로 주어질 수 있다.

(물론 이 또한 기부 혹은 봉사에 소요되는 경제적 비용보다 비경제적 효용이 더 크다는 것으로 설명될 수 있다.)</p>\\n<p>요컨대, 검증행위가 경제적으로는 손실일지라도 이 세상의 이타적인 누군가는 검증행위를 수행해줄 것이라는 것이 주장의 요지이다. 한 예로, 비트코인 혹은 이더리움 네트워크에서 일체의 마이닝 보상을 얻지 않지만 모든 일련의 블록 데이터들을 저장하고 이를 다른 노드와 공유하는 사람들이 분명히 존재한다. 이들은 이 행위로 어떠한 경제적 이익을 거두지 못하지만, 어떠한 이유로든 이타적으로 블록을 저장하고 공유하는 것이다.</p>\\n<p><em>하지만, 이 또한 문제가 아닌 것은 아니다. </em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/decrypt.co/24779/ethereum-archive-nodes-now-take-up-4-terabytes-of-space%3Famp%3D1\"><em>이더리움의 아카이브 노드 수가 적다</em></a><em>는 것은 꾸준히 제기되어 온 문제이다. 이더리움의 블록이 늘어남에 따라 상태 데이터는 계속해서 빠른 속도로 증가하고 있고, 이를 어떠한 인센티브도 없이 단순히 이타적인 참가자들이 아키이브 노드를 유지해줄 것이라 기대하는 것은 장기적으로 지속 불가능하다.</em></p>\\n<p>이는 일견 일리가 있어보이는 주장이지만, 우리는 검증자의 딜레마를 해결 또는 완화할 이론적 근거를 찾고 있다는 것에 유의해야 한다. 즉, 이타적 검증자는 실제로 롤업이 운영될 때 전체 네트워크의 관점에서 매우 도움이 되는 참가자들 이지만, 네트워크의 안전성을 보장하기 위해 어떠한 메커니즘 혹은 장치를 설계할 때 그 이론적 근거가 되어서도, 또한 될 수도 없는 요소이다.</p>\\n<p>만약 여러분이 이더리움의 설계자라고 가정해보자. 누군가 블록 데이터를 기록하고 보관할 인센티브가 명확하지 않은데, 이를 어떻게 해결할 생각인지 질문을 한다면 여러분은 어떻게 대답을 할 것인가. 적어도 그 대답이 세상에는 이타적인 사람들이 존재하기 때문에 어떻게든 이 사람들이 그 기록들을 모두 유지시켜 줄 것이라는 내용이라면 크게 설득력이 있다고 보기 힘들것이다.</p>\\n<p>비탈릭 부테린 또한 자신의 <a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html\">글</a>에서 다음과 같이 롤업의 검증 인센티브를 설계하는데에는 이타주의보다 더 명확한 이론적 근거가 필요하다고 주장하였다.</p>\\n<p><em>Auditing incentives — how to maximize the chance that at least one honest node actually will be fully verifying an optimistic rollup so they can publish a fraud proof if something goes wrong? For small-scale rollups (up to a few hundred TPS) this is not a significant issue and one can simply rely on altruism, </em><strong><em>but for larger-scale rollups more explicit reasoning about this is needed.</em></strong></p>\\n<h3>Fast Withdrawal</h3>\\n<p>마지막 근거는 바로 빠른 출금이다. 빠른 출금이 검증자의 딜레마를 고려할 필요가 없다는 주장의 근거로 제시되는 이유를 이해하기 위해서는 먼저 빠른 출금이 무엇인지 파악해야 한다.</p>\\n<p>빠른 출금은 롤업에서 DTD(Dispute Time Delay)로 인해 출금에 필요한 시간이 오래 걸리는 것에 대한 대안으로 제시된 방법이다. 빠른 출금은 일종의 중개인이 레이어 2의 사용자로부터 출금을 원하는 금액의 토큰을 사고, 레이어 1에서 해당 금액에서 수수료를 뺀 금액의 토큰을 사용자에게 바로 전송해주는 방법을 말한다.</p>\\n<p>앨리스와 이반의 예시를 통해 빠른 출금을 자세히 알아보자.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>앨리스는 이반에게 0.1ETH의 수수료를 지불하고 L2에서 L1으로 10ETH를 출금하고자 한다.</li>\\n<li>앨리스는 빠른 출금 마켓 컨트랙트에 10ETH를 송금한다.</li>\\n<li>이반은 출금 요청을 확인 및 검증하고 L1에서 앨리스에게 수수료를 제외한 금액 9.9ETH를 송금한다.</li>\\n<li>출금에 필요한 DTD가 지난 후에 이반은 L2의 컨트랙트에 보관된 10ETH를 취득한다.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>여기서 중요한점은 이반은 앨리스의 빠른 출금을 처리하는 과정에서 앨리스의 출금이 올바른 요청인지 아닌지를 검증하게 된다는 것이다. 이는 곧 롤업의 상태가 올바르게 구성되었는지 검증하는 것을 의미한다. 검증자의 딜레마에서 문제가 되는 지점은 검증자의 검증 보상이 시퀀서의 공격 행위가 발생할 확률에 의존한다는 점이었다. <strong>하지만 빠른 출금의 사례에서 이반은 시퀀서의 공격 행위와 무관하게 검증을 할 유인이 있는 것처럼 보인다!</strong></p>\\n<p>이를 바탕으로 Super-Simple Model에서와 같이 이반의 검증 및 비검증 기대보수를 정의해보자.</p>\\n<p>이반이 빠른 출금을 처리하여 받는 수수료가 F라고 할 때, 검증작업에 대한 이반의 기대보수는 다음과 같다. 이 때, 이미 롤업에는 이반 이외의 N명의 검증자가 있다고 가정한다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>검증 기대 보수: R*X + F - C</li>\\n<li>비검증 기대 보수: -L*X + (1-X)F</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>여기서 재밌는 것은 롤업의 다른 검증자들과 달리 이반은 다른 검증자들의 검증 여부가 자신의 검증 및 비검증 보수에 어떠한 영향도 끼치지 않는다는 것이다. 그 이유는 빠른 출금이 갖는 특수한 성질 때문인데, 이반은 앨리스에게서 출금 요청을 받은 후 가능한 빠른 시간 내에 L1에서 자신의 토큰을 송금하게 된다. <strong>하지만 만약 앨리스의 출금 요청이 실제로는 잘못된 요청이었다는 사실이 DTD내에 다른 검증자에 의해 밝혀지더라도 이반은 자신의 토큰을 돌려받을 수 없게 된다.</strong> 이미 L1의 토큰은 엘리스에게 전송되었기 때문이다. 즉, 이반이 빠른 출금을 안전하게 처리하기 위해서는 다른 검증자에 의존하는 것이 아닌 이반 스스로 검증 작업을 수행해야 한다는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>이는 상당히 흥미로운 사실인데, 만약 롤업에 단 두명의 검증자만이 존재하고 한명은 이반과 같은 빠른 출금의 중개인이고 다른 한명은 평범한 검증자(e.g 토큰 보유자, 댑 운영자 등)라면, 이반은 일반적인 검증자에 비해 검증 전략을 선택할 가능성이 더 높다. 다음 보수행렬표를 통해 이를 자세히 살펴보자.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VqcSS67HSirXtHbA05J3mw.png\"></figure><p>앞서 언급했듯, 상대 검증자가 검증 전략을 선택하더라도 이반은 빠른 출금을 이용한 시퀀서의 공격 행위를 효과적으로 방어하기 어렵다. 따라서 이반이 비검증 전략을 선택하는 경우의 기대보수는 모두 동일하게 -L*X+(1-F)X 이다. 이것이 시사하는 바는 이반과 검증자 두 참가자 중 누군가 한명은 반드시 검증 전략을 선택해야 하는 상황(두명의 일반적인 검증자가 존재하는 모델에서 시퀀서의 공격확률이 매우 높지도, 낮지도 않은 상황과 유사하다)에서 이반이 상대적으로 검증 전략을 선택할 유인이 더 높다는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>보다 구체적으로, 2C/R &gt; X &gt; C/(R/2+L+F) 인 경우에 균형은 (V, NV)가 된다. <em>앞서 두 검증자만을 다룬 모델에서는 동일한 조건하에 균형이 (V, NV) (NV, V) 였다.</em> 즉, 공격 확률이 높지도 낮지도 않은 상황에서 이반은 항상 검증 전략을, 상대 검증자는 항상 비검증 전략을 선택하게 될 것임을 의미한다. 이를 구체적인 예시를 통해 살펴보자.</p>\\n<p>다음과 같은 조건하에 이반과 검증자의 보수행렬표는 다음과 같이 구성된다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>R = 100</li>\\n<li>L = 100</li>\\n<li>F = 5</li>\\n<li>C = 1</li>\\n<li>X

출금의 중개인이므로 검증 전략이 우월 전략이 된다. 따라서, 상대 검증자는 항상 비검증 전략을 선택할 것이다. 따라서 (V, NV)가 균형이 된다.</p>\\n<p>정리하면, <strong>동일한 조건 하에서 빠른 출금의 중개인은 일반적인 검증자에 비해 검증 유인이 더 크다고 볼 수 있다.</strong> 즉, 누군가 검증을 하게 된다면 이는 빠른 출금의 중개인일 가능성이 매우 높다는 것이다. 하지만, 이 사실이 이반이 항상 검증 전략을 선택할 것임을 증명하는 것은 아니다.</p>\\n<p>다시 한번 강조하자면, 이반이 검증 전략을 선택하는 것에 대한 유인이 상대적으로 큰 것은 사실이지만, 실질적으로 이러한 전략적 선택을 할 때는 시퀀서의 공격 확률이 고려된다. 따라서 이제 우리가 중점적으로 보아야 하는 것은 빠른 출금의 중개인은 정확히 어떠한 기준으로 이러한 전략적 선택을 하게 되고, 이 중개인이 가능한 검증 전략을 선택하게 하려면 어떠한 요인이 필요한가를 알아보는 것이다. 이를 다음 장에서 구체적으로 알아보도록 하자.</p>\\n<h3>Fast Withdrawal and Auditing Incentives</h3>\\n<p>이 장에서는 빠른 출금의

전략이라고 부르겠다.</p>\\n<p>반대로 이반은 시퀀서의 빠른 출금 요청을 받으면 이를 검증하고 처리할 것인지 또는 검증을 하지 않고 처리할 것인지 선택할 수 있다. 이를 검증과 비검증 전략이라고 하겠다.</p>\\n<p>이 게임에서 이반과 시퀀서는 서로의 전략적 선택에 따라 얻을 수 있는 기대보수가 달라지게 되는데, 이는 구체적으로 다음과 같은

= 1/2</li>\\n<li>Q = 1/205</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>즉, 이반은 검증전략과 비검증전략을 각각 2번에 1번꼴로 선택한다. 반대로 시퀀서의 경우 205번에 1번꼴로 공격전략을 205번에 204번꼴로 비공격 전략을 선택하게 된다. 하지만 우리가 원하는 것은 이반이 오직 2번에 1번꼴로 검증전략을 선택하는 것이 아니라 이를 최대한 1에 가깝게 만드는 것이다. 또한 시퀀서의 공격확률을 1/205에서 0에 가깝게 줄이는 것이다. 이 두가지 목적을 모두 달성하기 위해서 우리는 어떠한 조치를 취해야 할까?</p>\\n<p><strong>가장 효과적인 방법은 L을 늘리는 것이다.</strong> L을 높이는 것은 검증자의 검증 전략 선택 확률을 높임과 동시에 시퀀서의 공격 전략 선택 확률을 줄이는 역할을 한다. 반대로, R을 높이는 것은 공격 확률을 줄이는 역할을 할 수는 있지만, 검증 전략 선택 확률은 오히려 줄이는 역할을 한다. 요컨대, 만약 롤업에서 자본 제한을 높여 검증자의 딜레마를 해결하려 한다면 L을 높이는 것이 가장 유효한 방법이라는 것이다. 하지만, 아쉽게도 이러한 자본제한을 높이는 방법은 명백히 한계가 존재한다. 따라서 우리는 이 문제를 해결하기 위해 다른 접근 방법이 필요하다.</p>\\n<h3>Maximin Strategy</h3>\\n<p>우리는 혼합전략 내쉬균형을 통해 이반과 시퀀서가 일정 확률에 따라 검증과 공격에 대한 전략적 결정을 내리게 된다는 것을 알아보았다. 하지만 과연 현실세계에서 이반과 시퀀서는 정확히 이 균형에 부합하는 확률로 각 전략을 선택하게 될것인가에 대해 의문이 생긴다. 두 경기자 모두 이익을 극대화하는 전략을 선택했을 때 추가적으로 얻는 기대 이익은 비교적 낮은 반면에 그 과정에서 잘못된 전략적 선택을 했을 때 발생하는 손실은 그야말로 재앙에 가깝기 때문이다.</p>\\n<p>예를 들어, 이반은 비검증전략을 선택할 경우 시퀀서가 공격을 하지 않는다면 단 1만큼의 추가 보수를 얻는 반면에, 시퀀서가 공격 전략을 선택했을 경우 -100이라는 큰 손실을 보게 된다. 시퀀서 또한 비공격시 얻는 것도 잃는 것도 없지만, 공격을 선택하고 실패했을 경우의 기대손실이 상대적으로 매우 크다.</p>\\n<p><strong>이러한 경우 일반적으로 경기자는 이익의 극대화보다는 안전성을 추구하는 경향이 있다. 이 때 경기자가 선택할 수 있는 전략이 바로 최소극대화 전략이다.</strong></p>\\n<p><em>이는 비단 이반의 검증 및 비검증 전략 선택에만 해당되는 이야기는 아니다. 예를 들어, 암호화폐를 거래하고 보유하는 사용자들은 리스크를 대하는 성향에 따라 암호화폐를 보관하는 방법에 있어 다양한 전략적 선택을 하게 된다. 암호화폐를 보유하고 거래할 때 일반적으로 가장 편리한 방법은 중앙화된 거래소에 보관하는 것이다. 하지만 이러한 방법은 거래소에 문제가 발생했을 경우 자신이 보유한 암호화폐를 잠재적으로 모두 잃어버릴 위험이 있다. 때문에 위험 회피 성향이 낮은 사용자들은 거래소에 암호화폐를 보관하고 거래하지만, 위험 회피 성향이 다소 높은 사용자들은 거래소에 암호화폐를 보관하지 않고 메타마스크와 같은 지갑 서비스를 이용하거나 혹은 하드웨어 월렛을 사용하게 된다. 이에 더해 위험 회피 성향이 극도로 높은 사용자는 암호화폐 자체에 문제가 생길 수 있으므로 동시에 풀 노드 혹은 아카이브 노드를 운영하게 된다. 이들 모두 암호화폐를 거래소에 보관했을 때 얻는 기대보수는 동일하지만, 위험 회피 성향의 정도, 즉 전략적 안전성을 얼마나 중요시 하느냐에 따라 전략적 선택이 달라지는 것이다.</em></p>\\n<p>최소극대화 전략은 경기자가 선택할 수 있는 전략이 각각 최악의 결과를 가져온다고 가정하고, 그 중에 그나마 큰 보수를 택하는 전략을 의미한다. 즉, 다른 경기자가 어떠한 결정을 하더라도 최소한으로 보장받을 수 있는 보수를 극대화하는 것이다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OHUKVdlmeSvzSy2Vj4Imag.png\"></figure><p>앞서 예시로 든 보수행렬표에서 이반과 시퀀서가 내쉬균형이 아닌 최소극대화 전략을 따른다고 가정해보자.</p>\\n<p>이 때, 이반의 최소극대전략은 V가 되고 시퀀서의 최소극대전략은 NA가 된다. 따라서 두 경기자의 최소극대 보수벡터는 (4,0) 이 된다. 다시 말해, 이반과 시퀀서는 최소극대화 전략을 선택할 경우 각각 항상 검증 전략과 비공격 전략을 선택하게 됨을 의미한다.</p>\\n<p><strong>따라서 우리는 이반과 시퀀서, 혹은 이반만이 전략적 안전성을 최우선으로 두고 있다는 가정하에 빠른 출금이 발생할 때마다 항상 해당 롤업은 검증될 것이라는 결론에 도달할 수 있다.</strong></p>\\n<p>하지만 모든 경기자가 전략적 안정성(stability)보다 안전성(security)을 우선한다고 가정하는것은 무리가 있다. 경기자의 성향은 각 개인마다 다를 것이기 때문이다. <strong>따라서 최소극대화 전략을 통한 접근은 검증자의 딜레마를 기존보다 다소 완화할 수는 있겠지만 이를 완전히 해결했다고 볼 수 없다.</strong></p>\\n<h3>Fast Withdrawal With Attention Challenge</h3>\\n<p>앞서 우리는 각 경기자가 전략적 안전성을 우선 가치로 둔다는 가정하에 검증자의 딜레마가 해결될 수 있다는 점을 살펴보았다. 하지만 이는 여전히 경기자의 성향에 대한 가정을 요구하므로, 검증자의 딜레마를 다소 완화했을 뿐 완전히 해결한것은 아니라는 점 또한 논의하였다.</p>\\n<p>만약 이러한 가정도 요구하지 않고 검증자의 딜레마를 해결하려면 어떠한 추가적인 장치가 필요할까? 빠른 출금의 사례에서 이반이 반드시 검증전략을 선택하지 않는 이유는 매우 단순하다. 검증전략이 우월전략이 아니기 때문이다.</p>\\n<p>반대로 생각해서 검증전략을 우월전략으로 만들기 위해서는 어떻게 해야할까? 이 또한 매우 단순하다. 비검증-비공격 전략에 대한 이반의 보수를 검증-비공격 전략의 보수보다 작거나 같도록 만드는 것이다. 우리는 빠른 출금에 주의 챌린지(Attention Challenge)를 도입하는 것으로 이러한 목적을 달성할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p><em>주의 챌린지는 Ed Felten의 글 </em><a

반드시 검증 전략을 선택하게 될 것이다. 이를 구체적인 예시를 통해 확인해보자.</p>\\n<p>각 변수의 값이 아래와 같을 때, 주의 챌린지를 적용한다면 다음과 같이 보수행렬표를 구성할 수 있다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>R = 100</li>\\n<li>L = 100</li>\\n<li>F = 5</li>\\n<li>C

모든 경우에서 기대 보수가 더 높으므로, 검증 전략이 우월전략이 된다. 시퀀서는 이반이 항상 검증 전략을 선택할 것이기 때문에 반드시 비공격 전략을 선택하게 된다. 따라서 <strong>(V, NA) 전략벡터가 순수전략 내쉬균형</strong>이 되며, <strong>이는 곧 롤업의 안전성이 항상 지켜질 수 있음을 의미한다!</strong></p>\\n<p><em>주의 챌린지를 일반적인 검증자에게 도입하게 되면, 이 경우 또한 검증 전략이 항상 우월전략이 될 수 있도록 유도할 수 있다. 하지만 주의 챌린지의 특성상 L1과의 상호작용을 요구하기 때문에 주의 챌린지의 대상과 확률을 확대하는 것은 시스템 차원에서 큰 부담이 될 수 있다. 이에 대한 자세한 내용은 </em><strong><em>Trade-Off of Attention Challenge</em></strong><em>에서 자세히 다룬다.</em></p>\\n<h3>Cross-Rollup Transaction</h3>\\n<p>앞서 우리는 빠른 출금의 중개인이 전략적 안정성이 아닌 안전성을 택할 경우나, 혹은 주의 챌린지를 도입했을 경우 반드시 롤업을 검증하는 전략을 선택할 것임을 확인하였다. 재밌는 점은 롤업에서 빠른 출금의 중개인과 완전히 동일한 보수 구조를 갖는 또 다른 참가자가 존재한다는 것이다. 이는 바로 크로스 롤업 트랜잭션(Cross-Rollup Transaction)의 중개인(이하 롤업 중개인)이다.</p>\\n<p><em>이 글에서 다루는 크로스 롤업 트랜잭션은 다음 두 글에서 다룬 내용을 바탕으로 한다.</em></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-rollup-dex-with-smart-contracts-only-on-the-destination-side/8778\"><em>Cross-rollup DEX with smart contracts only on the

방식으로 롤업과 롤업간의 빠른 토큰 전송 서비스를 제공할 수 있다. 예를 들어, 서로 다른 롤업 A와 B가 있고, 앨리스가 롤업 중개인 이반을 통해 토큰을 A에서 B로 전송하려고 할 때 다음과 같은 방식으로 이를 진행할 수 있다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>앨리스는 이반에게 0.1 ETH의 수수료를 지불하고 롤업 A에서 B로 10 ETH를 전송하고자 한다.</li>\\n<li>앨리스는 크로스 롤업 마켓 컨트랙트에 10 ETH를 송금한다.</li>\\n<li>이반은 크로스 롤업 트랜잭션 요청을 확인 및 검증하고 B에서 앨리스에게 수수료를 제외한 금액 9.9 ETH를 송금한다.</li>\\n<li>출금에 필요한 DTD가 지난 후에 이반은 A의 컨트랙트에 보관된 10 ETH를 취득한다.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>이를 통해 알 수 있는 것은 출금과 송금의 목적지만 L1에서 롤업 B로 달라졌을 뿐 다른 요소는 전혀 변경되지 않았다는 것이다. 이는 롤업 중개인 이반도 빠른 출금의 중개인 이반과 동일한 검증 및 비검증 기대보수를 갖는다는 것을 의미한다.</p>\\n<p>따라서 크로스 롤업 중개인 이반과 시퀀서의 보수 행렬표는 빠른 출금 중개인 이반과 시퀀서의 그것과 동일하게 아래와 같이 나타낼 수 있다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>R: 시퀀서 S의 보증금 / 검증 성공시 이반에게 주어지는 보상</li>\\n<li>L: 크로스 롤업 송금액 / 시퀀서의 공격 성공시 이반이 잃는 금액</li>\\n<li>F: 크로스 롤업 송금 수수료</li>\\n<li>C:

선택한다고 가정하거나, 또는 이와 같은 가정 없이 주의 챌린지를 적용하는 경우 항상 검증전략을 선택하게 된다.</p>\\n<p>이는 매우 고무적인 결과인데, 상대적으로 검증 유인이 높은 검증자의 수가 빠른 출금의 중개인에서 크로스 롤업 중개인까지 확대될 수 있음을 의미하기 때문이다.</p>\\n<h3>Trade-Off of Attention Challenge</h3>\\n<p>앞서 우리는 빠른 출금과 크로스 롤업 트랜잭션의 중개인에게 주의 챌린지를 도입하여 항상 검증 전략을 선택하도록 만들 수 있었다. 주의 챌린지 자체는 비단 이러한 중개인들뿐 아니라 다른 모든 검증자, 즉 롤업의 사용자에게 적용가능한 방법이다. 주의 챌린지를 확대해서 적용하면 모든 검증자들이 검증을 하는 것이 우월전략이 되므로, 이는 롤업의 안전성을 극대화하는 아주 좋은 전략이 될 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>하지만, 이는 두가지 측면에서 맹점이 존재한다.</p>\\n<p>첫째, 주의 챌린지에 응답하는 행위는 <strong>온체인(on-chain) 트랜잭션</strong>을 수반하므로, 주의 챌린지의 대상이 늘어난다는 것은 필요한 온체인 트랜잭션의 수가 많아진다는 것을 의미한다.</p>\\n<p>둘째, 롤업의 모든 사용자가 주의 챌린지의 대상이 된다면, 이는 롤업의 <strong>사용자 경험</strong>을 심각하게 저해할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>첫번째 이슈부터 자세히 논의해보자. 주의 챌린지의 대상이 늘어난다는 것은 필연적으로 주의 챌린지에 응답하는 대상의 수가 늘어나는 것을 의미한다. 물론 대상이 되는 검증자의 수(N)가 많아질수록 주의 챌린지의 대상으로 선정될 확률 P를 줄이면, 주의 챌린지에 대한 응답 횟수를 적절히 조절할 수 있으므로 문제가 없다고 할 수 있다. 하지만 P를 지나치게 줄이게 될 경우 주의 챌린지에 제대로 응답을 하지 못했을 경우 발생할 수 있는 기대 손실(-P*A)이 낮아지게 되고, 이는 곧 주의 챌린지가 검증전략이 항상 우월전략이 되도록 유도할 수 없게 될 수 있음을 의미한다. 물론 이 경우에도 A를 높여 이를 상쇄할 수 있겠지만, 이는 곧 자본제한을 높이는 것을 의미하기 때문에 바람직한 해결책이라고 보기는 힘들다. 요컨대, 검증자의 수를 늘리는 것은 주의 챌린지로 인해 더 많은 양의 온체인 트랜잭션이 발생할 수 있음을 의미한다.</p>\\n<p>두번째 이슈는 주의 챌린지의 대상을 무분별하게 확대할 경우 롤업의 사용자 경험을 저해할 수 있다는 것이다. 롤업의 장점은 모든 사용자가 검증자가 되지 않아도, 즉 최소한 한명의 정직한 검증자만 있어도 안전하게 동작할 수 있다는 것에 있다. 물론, 롤업의 정직한 검증자는 다다익선 이지만, 이것이 모든 사용자가 검증자가 되어야 한다는 것을 의미하는 것은 아니다. <strong>극단적으로 표현하면 롤업을 아무도 검증하지 않게 만드는 것만큼 바람직하지 않은 것이 모두가 롤업을 검증하게 만드는 것이다.</strong> 이는 이미 이더리움 커뮤니티에서 플라즈마의 단점을 논의할 때 충분히 논의된 것이므로 더 이상의 자세한 설명은 생략하겠다.</p>\\n<p>요컨대, 우리는 주의 챌린지를 무분별하게 적용해서는 안된다. <strong>가장 바람직한 것은 각 롤업이 달성하고자 하는 안전성 수준에 맞추어 적절한 대상에게 주의 챌린지를 현명하게 적용하는 것이다.</strong> 만약 빠른 출금과 크로스 롤업 트랜잭션이 활발하게 발생하고 있다면, 주의 챌린지를 굳이 적용하지 않아도 될 수 있다. (전략적 안전성을 택하는 중개인의 비율이 충분하다고 가정한다면 말이다.) 반대로, 롤업이 배포된 초기에는 빠른 출금이나 크로스 롤업 트랜잭션이 활발하게 발생하지 않을 수 있고, 활성화된 검증자의 수가 매우 적을 수 있다. 이러한 경우에는 주의 챌린지를 적극적으로 도입하는 것이 롤업의 안전성을 지키는데 큰 도움이 될 수 있다.</p>\\n<h3>Additional Reward to Attention Challenge</h3>\\n<p>주의 챌린지는 안전성을 극대화하는데 아주 효과적인 방법이지만, 검증자에게 일종의 부정 피드백(Negative Feedback)인 처벌로 검증을 유도한다. 이 때, 검증자는 주의 챌린지로 인해 검증 전략을 선택하게 되지만, 이러한 검증을 통해 추가적으로 얻는 보상은 없고 오직 비용만 추가적으로 발생할 뿐이다. 따라서 모든 검증자들은 주의 챌린지의 도입에 대해 긍정적인 관점으로 바라볼 수 없게 된다.</p>\\n<p>하지만, 주의 챌린지의 대상이 되는 검증자들에게 추가적인 보상을 지급할 수 있다면, 개별 검증자가 주의 챌린지로 인해 발생하는 경제적 비용을 완화하거나 이를 상회할 수 있을 것이다. 예를 들어, 특정 롤업에서 자체적으로 발행되는 토큰이 있고, 이 토큰의 일부가 주의 챌린지에 참여하는 검증자에게 보상으로 주어진다고 하자. 이 때, 이 보상의 양이 주의 챌린지의 응답비용보다 높다면 모든 검증자들은 주의 챌린지에 대해 어떠한 부담도 느끼지 않을 것이다.</p>\\n<p><em>사용자에게 추가적인 수수료를 징수하여 검증자에게 지급하는 것도 하나의 방법일 수 있다. 하지만 이 경우 사용자에게 추가적인 비용을 부과하는 것이 큰 부담이 되지 않도록 신중하게 비용의 수준을 조정해야 할 것이다.</em></p>\\n<h3>Repeated Game</h3>\\n<p>지금까지 다루었던 이반과 시퀀서의 검증게임은 모두 일회게임(one-shot game)이었다. 하지만 현실세계의 많은 경제활동은 동일한 주체들간의 반복적 상호작용으로 일어난다. 이와 마찬가지로 롤업 세상에서 일어나는 검증게임 또한 단 1회로 끝나는 것이 아니다. 이반과 시퀀서는 여러번에 걸쳐 진행되는 반복게임(repeated game)을 진행하게 될 것이다. 이들은 반복게임의 각 단계(stage)별로 이전에 각자가 행동했던 결과의 기록(history)에 따라 현재 단계에 대한 전략적 선택을 하게 될 것이다. 우리는 이러한 측면에서 이반과 시퀀서의 검증게임을 단순히 일회게임이 아닌 반복게임의 관점에서 분석해 볼 필요가 있다.</p>\\n<p>먼저 반복게임이 무한하게 진행되는 무한반복게임에서는 일회게임의 균형과는 다르거나 또는 더 많은 균형이 존재할 수 있다는 사실은 잘 알려져있다. 이는 바로 무한반복게임에서는 일회게임이나 유한반복게임과 달리 협조체제가 달성될 수 있기 때문인데, 현재 상대방을 속여 당장의 이득을 취하더라도 상대방의 보복에 따른 미래의 손실이 크다면 지금 유지되고 있는 협조관계를 깨지 않는 것이 유리하기 때문이다.</p>\\n<p>반대로 동일한 반복게임에 포함되지만, 반복횟수가 유한한 유한반복게임은 이야기가 전혀 다르다. 유한반복게임에서는 무한반복게임과 달리 반복횟수가 아무리 많아지더라도 협조체제 달성이 불가능하기 때문에, 유일한 내쉬균형을 갖는 일회게임은 아무리 많은 게임이 반복되더라도 경기자들은 매 단계마다 일회게임의 내쉬균형을 선택하게 된다.</p>\\n<p>여기서 우리가 주목해야할 점은 이반과 시퀀서의 검증게임을 어떠한 범주에서 바라보아야 하는가이다. 반복횟수가 무한할것인지 혹은 유한할것인지에 대해 논의하기 전에 앞서 한가지 질문에 대해 생각해보자.</p>\\n<p>만약 롤업 체인을 운영하는 시퀀서가 고의여부와 관계없이 트랜잭션을 올바르게 처리하지 않았다면 시퀀서와 이반(이반을 다수의 검증자들로 치환해도 좋다)은 어떻게 되는가?</p>\\n<p>먼저, 시퀀서의 부정행위가 DTD(Dispute Time Delay)내에 검증되었다고 가정해보자. 이 때 시퀀서는 자신의 보증금의 전부 혹은 일부를 몰수당할것이고, 일체의 시퀀서 권한을 박탈당할 것이다. 반대로 이반은 시퀀서의 보증금의 일부를 보상으로 받게 된다. 그리고 이후의 검증게임은 어떻게 되는가? 종료된다!</p>\\n<p>이번에는 시퀀서의 부정행위가 DTD이후에 ‘발견’되었다고 가정해보자. 이미 시퀀서에게 속고 빠른 출금을 제공해준 이반은 DTD가 지나서 시퀀서가 자신에게 준 토큰을 확인하지만 이내 그것이 올바르지 않은 값임을 발견할 것이다. 이 때, 시퀀서와 이반에게는 어떤 일들이 일어나는가? 먼저 이반은 이미 레이어 1에서 자신의 토큰을 빼앗긴 후이고, 이는 DTD이내에 검증되지 않았으므로 어떠한 보상도 받을 수 없게 된다. 반대로 시퀀서는 어떻게 되는가? 각 롤업의 사전에 정해진 규칙에 따라 상이할 수 있지만, 비록 DTD이내에 검증이 되지 않아 보증금을 몰수하지 못하고 기존의 상태값 또한 변경이 불가능 해도, 적어도 사후에 시퀀서의 역할 자체는 정지될 것이다. 즉, 이 경우에도 역시 이후의 검증게임은 종료되는 것이다.</p>\\n<p><em>여러분은 점원이 횡령을 했다는 것을 오랜 시간이 지난 후에 발견했다면, 이후의 가게 운영을 계속해서 맡기겠는가? 여러분이 천사가 아니라면 당연히 점원을 해고할 것이다. 이미 오랜 시간이 흘러 도둑질에 대한 금전적 책임은 물을 수 없더라도 말이다.</em></p>\\n<p>여기서 우리는 시퀀서가 공격을 하는 순간 검증자의 검증 여부와 관계없이 반복되는 검증게임은 종료된다는 것을 알 수 있다. 이를 통해 우리는 검증게임이 무한히 반복될 것이라고 가정하기보다 반복횟수는 사전에 정확히 알 수 없지만 유한한 횟수로 반복될 것이라고 가정하는 것이 보다 합리적이라는 것을 알 수 있다.</p>\\n<p><strong>따라서 이반과 시퀀서의 검증게임은 무한반복게임이 아닌 유한반복게임이라고 정의하는 것이 보다 합리적이고, 따라서 일회게임에서의 균형이 매 단계마다 반복될 것임을 알 수 있다.</strong></p>\\n<h3>Related Research</h3>\\n<p>앞서 검증자의 딜레마가 근래에 새롭게 제기된 문제가 아니라 이미 다양한 분야에서 제기되고 있는 문제중 하나라는 점을 지적했다. 때문에 이를 해결하려는 연구들 또한 이미 진행되어 왔다.</p>\\n<p>이 장에서는 다른 다양한 플랫폼에서 검증자의 딜레마를 해결하기 위해 제시한 솔루션들을 다룬다.</p>\\n<h3>Forced Error &amp; Jackpot — Truebit</h3>\\n<p>먼저 잭팟에 대해 자세히 설명하기 전에 <a href=\"https://truebit.io/\">트루빗(Truebit)</a>이 무엇인지 간단하게 알아보자. 트루빗은 일종의 오프체인 연산 솔루션으로, 이더리움의 낮은 블록 가스 리밋 제한으로 인해 실행이 불가능한 복잡도가 높은 트랜잭션을 오프체인에서 실행한 후 결과만을 온체인에 기록하는 방식으로 작동한다.</p>\\n<p>트루빗 프로토콜을 구성하는 구성원은 크게 3가지 타입으로 분류되며, 각 구성원이 수행하는 역할과 책임은 다음과 같다.</p>\\n<p>1. 의뢰인(Task Giver)</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>해결자에게 복잡한 트랜잭션에 대한 연산을 의뢰한다.</li>\\n<li>의뢰시 소정의 수수료를 해결자에게 지급한다.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>2. 해결자(Solver)</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>의뢰인의 작업을 오프체인에서 수행한다.</li>\\n<li>일정 금액의 보증금을 미리 예치한다.</li>\\n<li>작업을 올바르지 않게 수행했음이 증명되면 보증금을 몰수당한다.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>3. 검증자(Verifier)</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>해결자의 작업이 올바르게 수행되었는지 검증한다.</li>\\n<li>문제가 발견되었을 경우 일정 금액을 예치하고 검증게임(Verification Game)을 요청하여 해결자의 연산이 틀렸음을 증명한다.</li>\\n<li>검증게임에서 승리시 해결자의 보증금을 상금으로 받는다.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>여기서 단번에 파악할 수 있는 것은 트루빗 프로토콜이 안전하게 작동하기 위해서는 바로 검증자의 역할이 매우 중요하다는 것이다. 검증자가 해결자의 작업이 올바르게 수행되었는지 제대로 검증하지 않는다면 해결자가 오프체인에서 올바르게 연산한 결과만을 온체인에 제출했는지 확신할 수 없기 때문이다. 따라서 우리가 주목해야 할 것은 트루빗에서 검증자는 항상 검증을 수행할 용의가 있는가일 것이다.</p>\\n<p>눈치가 빠른 독자들은 트루빗 프로토콜의 검증자의 검증 및 비검증 효용은 앞서 논의한 Super-Simple Game의 그것과 비슷한 구조일 것이라 생각했을 것이다. 이는 실제로 그러하다. 트루빗의 검증 및 비검증 효용을 자세히 살펴보자.</p>\\n<p>만약 해결자가 올바르지 않은 연산 결과를 제출할 확률이 X라면, 검증자의 기대 보수는 다음과 같이 나타낼 수 있다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>검증 기대 보수: <em>R*</em>X-C</li>\\n<li>비검증 기대 보수: <em>0 (여기서 검증자는 해결자를 검증하는데 실패하더라도 어떠한 명시적 페널티도 없다)</em>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>이러한 모델에서 검증자의 검증에 대한 유인을 확실하게 보장하기 어렵다는것은 이제 너무나 자명한 사실이다. 물론, 트루빗 프로토콜의 설계자들 또한 이를 정확하게 인지하고 있었다. 이를 해결하기 위해 트루빗은 강제 오류(Forced Error)와 잭팟(Jackpot)을 도입하였다.</p>\\n<p>트루빗에서 검증자의 딜레마의 가장 큰 원인은 역시 검증자의 보상이 해결자의 공격 확률에 의존하기 때문이다. 이를 해결하는 것이 바로 강제 오류인데, 강제 오류는 해결자의 공격 여부와 관계없이 시스템에 의해 고의적으로 랜덤하게 발생되는 오류를 말한다. 즉, 해결자가 공격을 하지 않더라도 랜덤하게 강제 오류가 발생하므로, 검증자는 이를 검증하여 보상을 받을 수 있게 된다.</p>\\n<p>강제 오류에 대한 검증 보상은 해결자의 보증금을 이용할 수 없기 때문에 새롭게 보상금을 조달할 필요가 생긴다. 이것이 바로 잭팟이다. 의뢰인은 작업을 요청할 때마다 해결자에게 지급하는 수수료 외에 별도로 세금(Tax)를 지불하는데, 이 세금이 잭팟 보상금의 원천이 된다.</p>\\n<p>요컨대, 사용자에게서 소정의 수수료를 추가로 받아 보상풀을 형성하고, 이 보상금을 랜덤하게 발생한 강제 오류를 성공적으로 검증한 검증자에게 분배하는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>잭팟 보상은 정해진 기간 내에 강제 오류를 검증한 검증자 누구에게나 주어진다. 단, 수 많은 복제된 검증자 계정을 동원하여 잭팟 보상을 받는 시빌 공격(Sybil Attack)이 가능하므로, 트루빗은 보상의 분배를 강제 오류를 검증한 계정의 수에 비례하여 지수적으로 감소하도록 설계하였다. 정확한 잭팟 보상 분배 금액은 다음과 같이 계산된다.</p>\\n<ul><li>J/2^(k-1) (k = 강제 오류를 검증한 검증자 계정의 수)</li></ul>\\n<p>트루빗의 검증자는 잭팟으로 인한 기대보수가 검증비용보다 높다면 항상 검증을 할 유인이 있다고 볼 수 있다. 다시 말해, 강제 오류가 발생할 확률이 P라고 한다면, P*J/2^(k-1) &gt; C 일 때 트루빗의 검증자는 항상 검증을 할 유인이 있는 것이다. P와 J의 변수값은 해결자의 공격 확률과 달리 시스템적으로 통제 가능한 변수이므로, 검증자들로 하여금 항상 검증을 할 유인이 있도록 유도할 수 있을 것이다.</p>\\n<p>잭팟 모델은 이러한 장점이 있지만, 반대로 다음과 같은 이슈 또한 존재한다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>보상의 예측 불가능성</strong></li>\\n<li><strong>사용자에 추가적인 수수료 부과</strong></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>첫번째 이슈는 강제 오류의 발생 여부는 오직 확률적으로만 예측이 가능하다는 점이다. 운이 따른다면 단 한번의 검증만으로 보상을 받을수도 있고, 수백번의 검증후에도 보상을 받지 못할수도 있다. 기댓값은 예상이 가능하지만 잭팟은 일종의 복권과 같기 때문에 검증자의 꾸준한 참여를 이끌어내기에는 부적합한 측면이 있다. 이에 대한 자세한 내용은 <a href=\"https://www.deconlab.io/simulation-of-truebit-protocol-part-1/\">Decon에서 작성한 글</a>을 참고하라.</p>\\n<p>이와 더불어 강제 오류의 발생 여부는 구조상 특정 해결자가 가장 먼저 이 사실을 알게 된다. 이는 해당 해결자에게 강제 오류에 대한 배타적인 정보를 먼저 제공하므로, 해결자는 이를 활용하여 일체의 검증 행위 없이 잭팟 보상을 차지할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>둘째로, 잭팟 모델이 의도한대로 동작하기 위해서는 무엇보다 잭팟 보상금의 확보가 필수적이다. 잭팟 보상금이 충분히 크지 않다면 검증자에게 적절한 인센티브를 제공할 수 없게 된다. 하지만 잭팟 보상금은 작업 의뢰인이 모두 부담하게 되므로, 보상금의 크기를 늘리기 위해서는 필연적으로 의뢰인에게 추가적인 수수료가 부담되어야 한다는 것을 의미한다.</p>\\n<h4>Application to Rollup</h4>\\n<p>잭팟 모델은 여러 이슈가 존재하지만, 강제 오류와 잭팟 보상을 통해 검증자에게 검증 보상에 대한 기댓값을 검증 비용보다 높게 설정하여 검증 유인을 높일 수 있다는 측면에서 여전히 그 가치가 있다.</p>\\n<p>하지만 이를 롤업의 검증자의 딜레마를 해결하기 위해 활용하는것은 쉽지 않다. 그 이유는 첫째, 잭팟 보상금 기금 구성이 쉽지 않고, 둘째, 롤업은 강제 오류를 발생시키기에 적합한 구조는 아니라는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>먼저 잭팟 보상금 기금을 구성하기 위해서는 추가적인 재원이 필요한데, 이를 롤업의 사용자에게 추가적으로 부담하는것은 무리가 있다. 이에 대한 대안으로 해당 롤업의 생태계 차원에서 발행되는 별도의 토큰 보상을 지급할 수 있다. 하지만 모든 롤업이 이러한 토큰을 발행할 수는 없을 뿐더러, 잭팟 보상금이 해당 생태계에서 발행되는 토큰의 가치에 온전히 의존하기 때문에 안전성 측면에서 추가적인 위험이 발생할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>또한 롤업은 강제 오류를 발생시키기 매우 어려운 구조를 갖고 있다. 트루빗에서는 강제 오류를 위해 작업을 수행한 후 올바른 솔루션과 잘못된 솔루션을 모두 제출한다. 만약 강제 오류가 발생되어야 하는 상황이면 잘못된 솔루션을 지정한 후 강제 오류였음을 밝히게 되고, 반대의 경우 올바른 솔루션을 지정하게 된다. 트루빗은 각 의뢰인의 의뢰하는 작업들이 독립된 고유한 작업들이기 때문에 이러한 방식으로 강제오류를 유도하는 것이 크게 문제가 되지 않는다.</p>\\n<p>하지만 롤업에서 강제 오류를 발생시킨다면, 올바르지 않은 상태값을 기준으로 이후의 트랜잭션들을 처리해야 한다. 그렇지 않은 경우 누구나 강제 오류가 발생했다는 것을 쉽게 감지할 수 있기 때문이다. 또한 이러한 방식으로 트랜잭션을 처리한다고 하더라도 이는 이미 강제 오류가 발생한 상태를 기준으로 진행된 것이기 때문에 이후의 모든 상태값 또한 유효하지 않은 값이 된다. 요컨대, 롤업은 강제 오류를 발생시키기에 매우 까다로운 구조를 갖고 있는 것이다.</p>\\n<h3>Multiple Solvers — Truebit</h3>\\n<p>트루빗의 <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11476.pdf\">다중 해결자</a> 모델은 앞서 제시된 잭팟 모델의 여러 단점을 해결하고, 검증자의 딜레마를 완전히 해소하기 위해 새롭게 제시한 방법이다. 기존 트루빗이 3개의 역할군, 의뢰인, 해결자, 검증자가 명확하게 구분되어 있었다면, 다중 해결자 모델에서는 오직 의뢰인과 해결자만이 존재한다. 단, 하나의 해결자가 아닌 다수의 해결자를 두어 소수의 특정 해결자에 의해 안전성이 위협받는것을 방지한다.</p>\\n<p>다중 해결자 모델에서는 의뢰인이 작업을 의뢰하면, 해결자 풀(Pool)에서 랜덤하게 선택된 다수의 해결자가 해당 작업에 배정된다. 각 해결자는 작업에 대한 솔루션과 독립 실행 증명(Proof of Independent Execution)을 제출한다. 독립 실행 증명은 말 그대로 각 해결자가 스스로 작업을 해결했는지를 증명하는 과정이다. <em>독립 실행 증명이 구체적으로 어떻게 구성되는지는 </em><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11476.pdf\"><em>여기</em></a><em>서 확인하라.</em> 이를 통해 각 해결자는 다른 해결자의 솔루션을 복제하지 않았음을 증명할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>작업에 배정된 모든 해결자들은 스스로 작업을 수행하고 이에 대한 올바른 솔루션을 제출하지 않으면, 다른 해결자나 외부의 검증자(작업에 배정된 해결자가 아니더라도 여전히 누구나 검증은 수행할 수 있다)에 의해 챌린지 되어 자신의 예치금을 몰수당할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>단, 각 해결자들은 작업을 올바르게 수행한다면 이에 대한 보상으로 수수료를 받을 수 있고, 이 수수료가 검증 비용보다 높다면 해결자들은 항상 작업을 올바르게 수행할 유인이 있다고 할 수 있다. 즉, 다중 해결자 모델은 검증 작업과 작업을 해결하는 과정이 본질적으로 다르지 않다는 것을 파악하고, 이에 대한 보상을 명시적으로 주어 검증자의 딜레마를 해소한다.</p>\\n<p>하지만 다중 해결자는 한가지 치명적인 단점이 존재하는데, 바로 <strong>많은 비용</strong>을 필요로 한다는 것이다. 다중 해결자 모델은 각 작업에 배정되는 해결자의 수가 많으면 많을수록 더 높은 수준의 안전성을 보장할 수 있게 된다. 이는 곧 해결자에게 지불하는 수수료가 필연적으로 높아질 수 밖에 없음을 의미한다.</p>\\n<p>때문에 트루빗은 의뢰인이 원하는 안전성 수준에 따라 수수료를 지불할 수 있도록 한다. 더 높은 수준의 안전성을 원한다면 수수료를 많이 지불하여 더 많은 해결자들이 작업을 수행하도록 할 수 있고, 그렇지 않은 경우 수수료를 최소한으로 지불하여 소수의 해결자들이 작업을 수행하도록 할 수 있다.</p>\\n<h4>Application to Rollup</h4>\\n<p>다중 해결자 모델의 핵심은 해결자와 검증자를 별도로 분리하지 않고, 이를 하나로 통합하고 작업을 해결(검증)한 행위에 직접적으로 보상을 주는것에 있다. 즉, 롤업에서 이와 유사한 방식을 적용하려면 시퀀서와 검증자를 별도로 분리하는게 아니라 특정 트랜잭션을 처리할 때 하나의 시퀀서가 아니라 다수의 시퀀서가 각자 독립적으로 이를 실행한 후 이에 대한 상태 결과값을 레이어 1에 제출하도록 해야 한다.</p>\\n<p>중요한 점은 롤업을 가능한 안전하게 유지하기 위해 다수의 시퀀서에게 적절한 보상을 주어야 한다는 것인데, 이는 크게 사용자에게 추가적인 수수료를 받거나 생태계에서 발행되는 토큰 보상으로 방식으로 해결할 수 있다. 다만, 높은 수준의 안전성을 위해서는 더 많은 수수료와 더 많은 토큰 보상이 필요하므로 적절한 수준의 안전성과 비용 기준을 구체적으로 마련할 필요가 있다.</p>\\n<p>더불어, 기존의 롤업의 경우 레이어 1에 필요한 상호작용이 트랜잭션 데이터를 공유하는 행위와 트랜잭션을 처리한 후의 상태값을 저장하는 행위로 제한되었지만, 다중 시퀀서 모델을 도입할 경우 시퀀서의 수에 비례하여 상태값을 저장하는 행위와 독립 실행 증명에 필요한 트랜잭션 수가 선형적으로 증가한다. 이는 롤업의 본래 목적인 레이어 1의 확장성을 높이는 목적과 상충할 수 있다는 점에 유의해야 한다.</p>\\n<h3>Attention Challenge — Arbitrum</h3>\\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/offchainlabs/cheater-checking-how-attention-challenges-solve-the-verifiers-dilemma-681a92d9948e\">주의 챌린지(Attention Challenge)</a>는 검증자에게 올바르게 검증 작업을 수행하지 않았을 경우 이를 처벌하여 검증자의 딜레마를 해결하고자 한다. 주의 챌린지의 핵심은 검증자에게 추가적인 보상을 주어 검증을 독려하는 것이 아니라, 검증을 하지 않았을 경우 검증자에게 중대한 손실을 입혀 검증을 할 수 밖에 없도록 만드는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>주의 챌린지가 구체적으로 어떻게 작동하는지 알아보기 위해 앞서 다룬 Super-Simple Model로 돌아가보자. 이 단순한 모델에서는 두 참가자인 주장자, 검증자가 존재했다. 이 때 주장자가 어떠한 값 f(x)를 연산한다고 할 때, 이 값을 그대로 제출하지 않고 오직 x와 암호화된 f(x)만을 제출한다. 이 때 검증자는 x를 확인하고 올바른 f(x)값을 반드시 제출하여야 한다. 만약 검증자가 올바르지 않은 값을 제출하거나 정해진 시간에 응답하지 않을 경우 자신의 보증금을 잃게 된다.</p>\\n<p>물론, 주의 챌린지에 응답하기 위해서는 온체인(on-chain) 트랜잭션이 필요하므로, 항상 검증자가 주의 챌린지에 응답해야 한다면 이는 레이어 1과 검증자에게 많은 부담이 될 것이다. 따라서, 주의 챌린지는 각 검증자에게 항상 적용되는 것이 아니라 확률적으로 적용된다. 단, 각 검증자가 주의 챌린지의 응답 대상이 되었는지는 오직 스스로 검증 작업을 수행한 후에만 확인할 수 있게 설계된다. 따라서 검증자들은 오프체인(off-chain)에서 f(x)를 연산하여 항상 검증작업을 수행하지만 오직 주의 챌린지의 대상이 되었을 경우에만 이러한 값들을 온체인에 제출하게 된다.</p>\\n<p><em>구체적으로 f(x)가 어떻게 암호화되는지, 각 검증자들이 어떻게 챌린지의 응답 대상이 되었는지 확인하는지에 대한 기술적인 사항들은 </em><a href=\"https://medium.com/offchainlabs/cheater-checking-how-attention-challenges-solve-the-verifiers-dilemma-681a92d9948e\"><em>원 글</em></a><em>을 참고하라.</em></p>\\n<p>Super-Simple Model에 주의 챌린지를 적용할 경우 검증자의 검증 및 비검증 기대 보수는 다음과 같이 변경된다.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>검증 기대 보수: R*X-C</li>\\n<li>비검증 기대 보수: -L*X -P*A</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><em>P는 주의 챌린지의 응답 대상이 될 확률이고, A는 잘못된 응답을 제출했을 때 몰수되는 보증금을 의미한다.</em></p>\\n<p>이 때, P*A &gt; C 이면 검증자는 주장자의 공격 확률인 X와 관계 없이 항상 검증을 하는것이 최선의 선택이 된다. P와 A에 대한 적절한 변수값은 시스템에 의해 통제될 수 있으므로, 검증자로 하여금 항상 검증을 하도록 유도할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>주의 챌린지는 사용자에게 별도의 추가적인 비용을 발생시키지 않고, 검증자로 하여금 항상 검증을 하도록 유도할 수 있다는 점에서 매우 매력적이다. 하지만 주의 챌린지에는 한가지 맹점이 존재하는데, 만약 검증자가 검증을 수행하면서 주장자가 어떠한 공격도 하지 않아 이에 대한 보상을 얻지 못할 경우, 모든 경우에 대해 손실을 볼 수 있다는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>예를 들어, 아래와 같은 조건에서 검증자의 기대 보수는 다음과 같이 나타낼 수 있다.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>R = 100</li>\\n<li>L = 10</li>\\n<li>X = 0</li>\\n<li>C = 1</li>\\n<li>P*A = 5</li>\\n</ul>\\n<ol>\\n<li>검증 기대 보수 = -1</li>\\n<li>비검증 기대 보수 = -5</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>이 때, 검증자는 검증 기대 보수(-1)가 비검증 기대 보수(-5)보다 더 크므로 검증을 하게 될 것이다. 하지만 여기에는 한가지 <strong>함정</strong>이 존재한다. 바로 어떠한 선택을 하더라도 검증자는 <strong>순수하게 손실</strong>만 입는다는 것이다! 즉, 검증자는 더 큰 손실을 피하기 위해 작은 손실을 감수하는 상황에 처하게 되는 것이다. 만약 검증자가 강제로 이러한 상황에 놓이게 된다면 별다른 방법이 없겠지만, 이를 시스템적으로 강제할수는 없을 것이다. 즉, 검증자가 원하면 검증자의 역할을 포기하고 보증금을 인출하여 이 시스템을 떠날 수 있다는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>만약 여러분이 이 검증자라면 어떤 선택을 하겠는가? 기약없는 수익을 기다리며 이 시스템에 남아 검증을 계속하겠는가? 또는 어차피 나에게 주어지는 보상은 아무것도 없고, 비용만 지출되니 검증자를 포기하고 떠나겠는가? 아마 모든 이들은 후자를 선택할 것이다.</p>\\n<p>이 예시를 통해 알 수 있는 것은 주의 챌린지는 검증자가 항상 비검증이 아닌 검증 전략을 선택하도록 유도할수는 있지만, 검증자가 계속해서 검증자의 역할을 지속적으로 수행하도록 유도하지는 못한다는 것이다.</p>\\n<p>그렇다면 주의 챌린지는 아무런 효용도 없는 장치인가? 그렇지 않다. 주의 챌린지는 검증자의 딜레마를 해결하는데 매우 효과적인 장치이다. 단, 주의 챌린지의 대상이 되는 검증자들이 검증 작업과 연관된 또는 연관되지 않은 일정한 수익을 얻을 수 있을때만 그 효과를 발휘한다.</p>\\n<p>예를 들어, 검증자가 검증 단위마다 일정한 수익 F를 얻는다면, F - C &gt; -P*A 일 때, 검증자는 항상 검증 전략을 선택하고 더불어 검증자의 역할을 계속해서 수행하지 않을 이유를 찾기가 어려울 것이다. 우리는 이러한 조건이 적용될 수 있는 모델을 하나 알고 있다. 바로 롤업이다!</p>\\n<h4>Application to Rollup</h4>\\n<p>롤업에서는 검증자의 역할이 명확히 구분되지 않고, 여러 구성원들이 검증자의 역할을 겸하게 된다. 그리고 이러한 구성원 중 일부는 검증 단위인 트랜잭션마다 일정한 수익을 얻는다. 예를 들어, 롤업에서 이자 농사(Yield Farming)를 하고 있는 사용자나 DEX를 운영하는 개발자는 트랜잭션이 처리될 때마다 일정한 수익을 얻을 수 있다. 이러한 경우 주의 챌린지를 적용하면 이들 구성원이 확실하게 롤업을 검증할 수 있도록 유도할 수 있다. 이에 대한 자세한 내용은 이미 앞에서 다루었기 때문에 추가적인 설명은 생략하겠다.</p>\\n<h3>Why do I care so much about Verifier’s Dilemma?</h3>\\n<p>이 글은 지속적으로 롤업의 모든 구성원들에게 안전을 보장하기 위해서는 검증자의 딜레마를 반드시 고려해야하고, 이에 대한 적절한 해결책을 고려할 필요성이 있다고 주장하고 있다. 이에 대한 여러가지 근거를 앞에서 제시했지만, 여전히 이에 동의하지 않는 사람들이 있을 수 있다. 이는 어디까지나 이론적인 측면일 뿐, 실제로 롤업이 활발하게 도입되어 사용될 때, 막상 검증자의 딜레마가 크게 문제가 되지 않을 수 있기 때문이다. 세상에는 자신에게 아무런 이익이 되지 않아도 다른 이들을 도와주는 이타적인 사람들도 있고, 또한 자신의 이익을 극대화하기 보다 이익을 조금 포기하더라도 스스로와 다른 사람들을 위해 차선을 선택하는 이들도 있다. 롤업에서도 이와 비슷한 상황이 전개될수도 있다.</p>\\n<p><strong>하지만 이 글에서 주장하고 싶은것은 롤업에서 검증자의 딜레마를 고려하지 않는다면 해당 롤업은 ‘반드시’ 위험에 빠지게 될 것이라는 것이 아니다. 다만, 이러한 측면을 사전에 주의 깊게 고려하지 않는다면 매우 낮은 확률이라도 예상치 못한 위기가 닥쳤을 때, 롤업의 안전성이 크게 위협받을 ‘가능성’이 있다는 것이다.</strong></p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*I_nF8NFH0P57hBRPrgeoXw.png\"><figcaption>(Source: Shutterstock)</figcaption></figure><p>잠시 롤업이 아닌 다른 이야기를 해보자. 예를 들어, 우리가 현대화된 도시에 거주하는 시민을 위한 자동차를 설계한다고 해보자. 이 차는 아마도 잘 정비된 도시의 도로에서만 달리게 될 것이기 때문에, 굳이 어떠한 극한 환경에서도 잘 동작하도록 애를 쓸 필요는 없을 것이다. 4륜구동이 아니어도 될 것이고, 낙차가 높은 곳에서 떨어질 일도 없을 것이기 때문에 값비싼 충격 완화 장치를 추가할 필요도 없다. 사막을 달릴 일도 없을 것이기 때문에 모래 먼지를 고려할 필요도 없고, 폭설과 폭우에도 그렇게 많은 신경을 쓸 필요가 없다. 어차피 그런 일은 잘 일어나지도 않을 뿐더러 도로 또한 항상 잘 정비되어 있을 것이기 때문에 평범한 차도 무리 없이 잘 달릴 수 있을 것이다.</p>\\n<p>하지만 반대로, 어떤 종류의 극한 환경에서도 항상 문제 없이 잘 달릴 수 있는 차를 설계하고자 한다면 이야기는 완전히 달라진다. 만약 충분한 안전장치가 없다면 이러한 환경에서는 운전자와 승객의 생명을 크게 위협할 수도 있다. 때문에, 추가적인 비용이 발생하고 설계가 다소 복잡해지더라도 가능한 차를 안전하게 설계하는것이 최우선사항이다. 이렇게 설계된 차 또한 물론 대부분의 주행이 도시 환경에서 이루어질 수도 있다. 이런 상황에서는 이 차에 들어간 여러 비용과 설비가 다소 불필요하고 과하게 느껴질 수도 있다. 하지만 이 차는 극한 환경에 처했을 때 그 진가를 발휘할 것이다. 갑자기 폭설이 쏟아져 다른 모든 평범한 차들은 한 치도 움직일 수 없을 때, 이 차는 홀로 문제 없이 잘 달릴 것이다.</p>\\n<p>다시 롤업과 블록체인의 이야기로 돌아와서, 여러분은 이 두가지 종류의 차 중에 어떤 것이 롤업에 가깝다고 생각하는가? 나는 블록체인을 믿는 사람이라면 누구나 롤업, 아니 나아가 모든 블록체인 기술은 후자의 성격에 더 가깝다는것에 동의할 것이라 믿는다. 블록체인 기술은 <a href=\"https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274\">탈중앙화를 통해 시스템이 처할 수 있는 모든 극한 환경을 극복(장애 허용, 공격 저항, 담합 저항)</a>하고자 한다. 비록 그것이 매우 드물게 발생하는 상황일지라도 말이다. 롤업 또한 마찬가지다. 롤업은 극한 상황에 대한 대처 능력을 레이어 1과 동일한 수준에 가깝게 구현하되, 레이어 1의 부족한 확장성을 대폭 증가시키기 위한 기술이다. 따라서 우리는 롤업이 이러한 목적대로 모든 극한 환경을 잘 극복할 수 있도록 노력할 필요가 있다.</p>\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\n<p>옵티미스틱 롤업은 당면한 이더리움의 확장성 문제를 중단기적으로, 또한 장기적으로도 획기적으로 해결할 수 있을 것으로 기대되는 레이어 2 솔루션이다. 물론, 현재까지 많은 레이어 2 솔루션이 제시되었고, 특히 유효성 증명(Validity Proof)을 활용하는 zk-롤업(zk-Rollup)은 옵티미스틱 롤업과 다르게 즉시 완결성(Finality)을 부여할 수 있다는 측면에서 각광을 받고 있다. 하지만, 이더리움의 모든 복잡한 트랜잭션들을 zk-롤업으로 처리하기에는 현 시점에서 분명한 한계가 존재하기 때문에, 당분간 이더리움을 위한 현실적인 주요 대안은 옵티미스틱 롤업이 될 것이다.</p>\\n<p>앞으로 옵티미스틱 롤업은 매우 광범위하게 활용될 것이고, 매우 대중화(Mass Adoption)될 것이다. 롤업의 수가 많아지고, 그 규모가 커질수록 안전성에 대한 이슈는 더욱 더 중요해질 것이다. 계속해서 강조하지만, 롤업은 단 한명의 정직한 검증자만 존재해도 시스템이 안전하게 유지될 수 있다는 점에서 매우 매력적인 레이어 2이다.</p>\\n<p>하지만 이 글에서 계속해서 논의한 바와 같이, 롤업에서 검증자는 시퀀서의 공격확률이 높지 않다면 검증을 할 유인보다는 그렇지 않을 유인이 더 크다. 때문에 롤업이 안전하게 동작하는 시간이 늘어날수록 활성화된 검증자의 수는 빠르게 줄어들 것이다. 빠른 출금 및 크로스 롤업 트랜잭션의 중개인들 또한 완전한 예외는 아니다. 요컨대, 롤업은 역설적으로 안전해질수록 위험해질것이다. 하지만 우리는 한가지 대안을 알고 있다. 바로 주의 챌린지를 적절하게 적용하는 것이다. 주의 챌린지를 적용할 경우 우리는 롤업의 안전성을 확실하게 보장할 수 있다.</p>\\n<p>물론, 이 글은 모든 롤업에 주의 챌린지를 반드시 적용해야 한다고 주장하는 것은 아니다. 각 롤업마다 목표로 하는 수준의 안전성이 있을 것이고, 참가자들의 성향에 대한 가정이 있을 것이다. 만약 높은 안전성을 보장하지 않아도 되거나, 이타주의자, 위험을 극도로 회피하는 참가자들의 비율이 충분히 높다고 판단된다면 굳이 주의 챌린지를 적용할 필요는 없다. 중요한것은 각자의 목적에 맞게 필요한 도구를 적절하게 사용하는 것이다. 이 글이 각 롤업의 안전성을 설계할 때 조금이나마 도움이 되었으면 한다.</p>\\n<h3>Glossary</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>시퀀서: 옵티미스틱 롤업에서 사용자들의 트랜잭션 순서를 결정하고, 해당 트랜잭션들을 처리한 후의 상태값과 트랜잭션

In particular, The versatility of TON will be further expanded by combining the real economy closely with real life and the infrastructure of Paycoin, which has a wide range of alliances.</p>\\n<p>Thank you.</p>\\n<p>안녕하세요! 온디맨드 레이어 2 플랫폼 ‘토카막 네트워크’입니다.</p>\\n<p>토카막 네트워크는 블록체인 기반의 가상자산 결제서비스를 운영하는 다날핀테크와 전략적 업무협약(MOU)를 체결했습니다.</p>\\n<h3>What is PayCoin</h3>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GKgYwkmTG2Bagivc45G2Dw.png\"></figure><p>다날핀테크가 전개하는 페이코인 프로젝트는 한국의 통합 결제 시스템 업체 다날(Danal)이 진행하는 리버스 프로젝트로, CU, 세븐일레븐, 미니스톱에 이어 이마트24 편의점 매장과 CGV 영화 등 국내 7만개 이상의 온/오프라인 제휴점에서 가상자산인 간편하게 페이코인(PCI)으로 결제할 수 있는 인프라를 갖추고 있는 것이 특징입니다. 최근에는 사용자 수 130만명을 돌파하였으며 유니온페이와의 제휴를 통해 한국과 중국 지역을 제외한 전 세계 유니온페이 가맹점에서 결제할 수 있는 ‘다날-유니온페이 모바일 선불카드’를 출시하기도 했습니다.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/560/1*DCteAf01R8qifCkj3h6nMw.png\"></figure><p>다날의 20년 노하우가 담긴 결제 시스템과 블록체인 기술의 결합을 통해 별도의 인프라 없이 다양한 환경에서 이용 가능한 새로운 결제 수단을 제공하고자 하며, 기존 결제 시장이 직면한 높은 수수료, 느린 정산 주기 등 문제점을 개선하는 것을 목표로 암호화폐의 실물 결제 서비스 대중화를 위해 노력하고 있습니다.</p>\\n<h3>Purpose of MOU</h3>\\n<p>이번 MOU는 토카막 네트워크의 톤과 페이코인을 맞교환할 수 있는 것을 골자로 하고 있습니다. 이를 통해 톤 보유자는 향후 페이코인 앱 내 맞교환을 통해 페이코인의 인프라를 활용해 간단하게 결제가 가능하게 될 예정입니다. 아울러 페이코인(PCI)과 톤(TON) 스왑 기능이 구현되면 사용자들은 평소에 접하기 힘든 가상자산 기반의 예치 서비스를 페이코인 앱을 통해 손쉽게 이용할 수 있게 지원할 계획도 함께 진행 중입니다.</p>\\n<p>또한 다날핀테크는 토카막 네트워크의 스테이킹 파트너로 참여해 토카막 네트워크의 검증에도 함께 참여할 예정입니다.</p>\\n<p>저희는 이번 다날핀테크와의 MOU를 통해 토카막 네트워크의 생태계는 더욱 확장될 것이라고 기대하고 있습니다. 특히 실생활과 밀접한 실물 경제와 광범위한 제휴점을 보유한 페이코인의 인프라와 맞물려 톤의 범용성이 더욱 확대될 것이라고 믿습니다.</p>\\n<p>감사합니다.</p>\\n<h3>* Tokamak Official Channels</h3>\\n<p>📌Tokamak Global Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/tokamak_network\">https://t.me/tokamak_network</a><br>📌Tokamak Global Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/SZw2WSR\">https://discord.gg/SZw2WSR</a><br>📌Tokamak Network Homepage: <a href=\"https://tokamak.network/\">https://tokamak.network/</a><br>📌Tokamak Network Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tokamak_network\">https://twitter.com/tokamak_network</a><br>📌Tokamak Network Medium: <a href=\"https://medium.com/onther-tech\">https://medium.com/onther-tech</a></p>\\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=500c8c05c507\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/onther-tech/welcome-our-new-partner-paycoin-to-tokamak-network-community-en-kr-500c8c05c507\">Welcome our new partner Paycoin to Tokamak Network community!

This post explains how the <a href=\"https://github.com/Onther-Tech/tokamak-dao-contracts\">Tokamak DAO smart contract system</a> works in detail and how users can contribute to the ecosystem.</p>\\n<h3>Contract overview</h3>\\n<p>DAO contracts have the authority of almost all contracts related to the Tokamak Network and have the authority to execute functions that change the state value of each contract. Specifically, in order to change the state, the user creates an agenda for the function execution in Tokamak DAO, and then the committee’s decision is made, and the execution is decided according to the result of the committee decision.</p>\\n<p>The DAO Contract controls the status of the agenda such as the management of qualifications for the members of the DAO Committee, proposals, and voting of agendas. In addition, functions such as voting for DAO candidates are designed to incentivize voters for rewards from voting by utilizing the existing Tokamak Network staking contract.</p>\\n<p>This post will explain the composition, role, and functional characteristics of the DAO contract.</p>\\n<h3>Election</h3>\\n<p>All users can vote for any DAO candidate. Since this voting takes the form of depositing TON, users can vote for that candidate by depositing TON on the same candidate. Since these TON deposits use the Tokamak Network’s staking contract, voters can get rewards proportional to the TON they voted for.</p>\\n<p>The amount of votes received by a DAO candidate equals the total amount of TON delegated to that candidate. This voting amount includes the amount deposited by the candidate himself/herself.</p>\\n<p>The user’s vote for candidates is the same as the structure of staking, so all of the functions below are managed by the Tokamak Network staking contract.

TON delegation is managed by the contract that manages the staking service of Tokamak Network, and you can get rewards in proportion to the amount and duration of the delegation.</p>\\n<h4>Unvote</h4>\\n<p>This is the procedure for requesting the release of the TON voted for a DAO candidate. When the vote is canceled, withdrawal is not made immediately and can be withdrawn after a certain period (currently 14 days) after requesting. This period value is identical to the one managed by Tokamak Network staking contract.</p>\\n<h4>Revote</h4>\\n<p>After requesting to unvote, you can still vote again for TON that have not yet been withdrawn. It is like re-staking of the Tokamak Network staking service.</p>\\n<h4>Withdrawal</h4>\\n<p>This is the procedure to withdraw the TON requested for unvote. You can withdraw after a certain period (currently 14 days) after the request.</p>\\n<h3>DAO Committee</h3>\\n<p>The DAO Committee of Tokamak Network is managed by a Committee contract. The Committee provides functions related to other tasks such as registration of candidates, management of member addition, change, removal, etc., and registration and execution of agendas.</p>\\n<p>The AO Committee can be defined as an organization with substantial voting rights on Tokamak DAO agendas. Tokamak Network DAO Committee is managed by a Committee Contract. The Committee Contract performs the main functions of DAO, such as registering candidates, adding, changing, and removing members, and registering and executing agenda.</p>\\n<h4>Delegator</h4>\\n<ul><li>Voting on candidates (TON delegation)</li></ul>\\n<p>All users can delegate (deposit) TON to any candidate of their choice and receive interest (newly issued TON, seigniorage) managed by the SeigManager contract.</p>\\n<ul><li>Agenda creation</li></ul>\\n<p>All users can create an agenda by consuming a certain amount of TON as a fee.</p>\\n<h4>Candidate</h4>\\n<p>Anyone can register as a candidate, and Layer 2 contracts managed by the SeigManager contract can also be registered as candidates. All candidates can use SeigManager contract features such as function updateSeigniorage() and adjusting commission rates.</p>\\n<p>All candidates can interact with the DAO contract through the Candidate contract. If the candidate is a Layer 2 contract, the operator can use the Candidate contract.</p>\\n<ul><li>Layer 2 and DAO candidate</li></ul>\\n<p>It is also possible to register as a DAO candidate while the Layer 2 contract has already been registered. In this case, Layer 2 can operate as a multiple candidate while operating Layer 2. At this time, the management of Layer 2 and the activities as a candidate for DAO will be conducted by the Layer 2 operator.</p>\\n<p>In addition, the TON delegated to the Layer 2 contract is considered as the amount voted for the DAO candidate.</p>\\n<h3>Committee Member</h3>\\n<ul><li>Member Slot</li></ul>\\n<p>The DAO contract has as many seats as the maximum number of members. The initial slot is assigned ZERO_ADDRESS, and each candidate can change members if they meet the criteria for selection of members.</p>\\n<ul><li>Member selection criteria</li></ul>\\n<p>The amount of votes for the candidates is equal to the amount of TON each candidate has been delegated. This vote is managed by the SeigManager contract, and the amount includes the amount deposited by the candidate himself.</p>\\n<ul><li>Member replacement</li></ul>\\n<p>If the number of votes for the candidate (the amount of TON deposited) is greater than the number of votes of a specific member, the candidate can occupy the slot of that member through the Candidate contract.</p>\\n<h3>Proposal</h3>\\n<ul><li>Agenda proposal</li></ul>\\n<p>Each agenda refers to an agenda that executes a specific function of specific contracts with a specific parameter, and these values are entered by the agenda creator when creating the agenda.</p>\\n<p>Anyone can create an agenda, and it burns a certain amount of TON as an agenda creation fee. This fee is currently 100 TON and can be adjusted.</p>\\n<ul><li>Agenda voting process</li></ul>\\n<p>The agenda starts its notice period from the time it is created. It has a voting period after the notice period ends. The notice period and voting period have minimum values, and can be set when creating an agenda. Also, a passed agenda has an execution period, which can only be executed within the execution period and cannot be executed after it expires. The execution period has a common value for all agendas.</p>\\n<p>During the notice period, there is no change in the status of the agenda, and after the end of the notice period, the agenda member is determined by the committee member at the time the transaction occurs. Only members of the agenda can vote on the agenda, and the voting period begins when the first voting transaction occurs after the notice period.</p>\\n<p>During the voting period, voters can vote on the agenda. Voting is done in yes/no/abstain, and the voting result is changed when the quorum is satisfied. If the vote is confirmed by filling the quorum, the passed agenda cannot be executed immediately but after the voting period is over.</p>\\n<p>Passed agendas have a certain period of execution after the voting is over. Anyone can execute the agenda within the execution period and change the contract status of Tokamak Network according to the agenda.</p>\\n<h3>DAO Vault</h3>\\n<h4>Source</h4>\\n<p>DAO vault contains tokens that can be used through DAO. The tokens entering the vault include the amount allocated for part of the total issuance of TON (35% of the initial issuance), and part of the seigniorage (additional issuance) issued from Tokamak Network staking.</p>\\n<h4>Approve</h4>\\n<p>The agenda allows you to approve the tokens stored in the Vault. Target token is TON, WTON or token with token address entered.</p>\\n<p>Through the agenda, you can execute the function approve() on the tokens stored in the vault. Target token is TON, WTON or token with token address entered.</p>\\n<h4>Claim</h4>\\n<p>Tokens stored in the vault by agendas can be withdrawn immediately. Target token is TON, WTON or token with token address entered.</p>\\n<h3>Others</h3>\\n<h4>DAO candidate / Members / Voters by agenda</h4>\\n<p>Below is a schematic diagram of the relationship between DAO candidates, members, and voters by agenda.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*K2TJcv6NFqOJxo-W\"></figure><p>At the bottom of the diagram, different committee members are assigned to each agenda, and you can see the voting process accordingly.</p>\\n<h4>Proxy pattern and upgradeable functions</h4>\\n<p>Tokamak DAO is designed in consideration of the possibility of functional expansion and upgrade during the deployment and operation of the contract. The DAO Committee management contract is based on the DAO proxy pattern, which separates storage and logic.</p>\\n<p>Users can access DAO committee and basic services through the DAOCommitteeProxy contract. The DAOCommitteeProxy contract address is directly exposed to users and is managed as an address that does not change during service.</p>\\n<p>By using the function upgradeTo() in the DAOCommitteeProxy contract, you can expand and upgrade the DAO service by changing the address of the DAOCommittee contract in charge of the DAO service logic. Based on these structural features, DAO is expected to provide a more user-friendly and proactive user experience by allowing maintenance and upgrades to proceed smoothly without service interruption even in the process of using the contract.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/617/0*gcMeOi95-Z_Uuewf\"></figure><h4>Contract Diagram</h4>\\n<p>Diagrams of the all DAO service contracts are as follows.</p>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*_3hGiAhAslQjsD5K\"></figure><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ae51b9eaeaf3\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\"><hr>\\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/onther-tech/all-about-toakamk-dao-2-en-ae51b9eaeaf3\">All about Tokamak DAO (2) [EN]</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/onther-tech\">Onther</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\\n',\n                content:\n                  '\\n<h4><strong>Tokamak DAO smart contract</strong></h4>\\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/693/0*Y4GsfH_TnixRybY3.png\"><figcaption>Tokamak DAO Smart Contract</figcaption></figure><blockquote>\\n<em>(1) </em><a href=\"https://medium.com/onther-tech/all-about-tokamak-dao-1-en-96fa3453a1ee\"><em>What is Tokamak DAO</em></a>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<em>(2) </em><a href=\"https://medium.com/onther-tech/all-about-toakamk-dao-2-en-ae51b9eaeaf3\"><em>Tokamak DAO smart contract</em></a><em> &lt;- Here</em>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote><em>(3) DAO user interface and its use</em></blockquote>\\n<blockquote><em>(4) FAQ</em></blockquote>\\n<h3>Index</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Abstract</li>\\n<li>Contract overview</li>\\n<li>Election</li>\\n<li>DAO Committee</li>\\n<li>Proposal</li>\\n<li>DAO Vault</li>\\n<li>Others</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Abstract</h3>\\n<p>Tokamak DAO is a system for making decisions about various things that affect the Tokamak Network ecosystem.
